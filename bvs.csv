Despite the progress in neurobiological research, the pathophysiology of BD has not been extensively described to date. Progress in the understanding of the neurobiology driving BD could help facilitate the discovery of therapeutic targets and biomarkers for its early detection. Oxidative stress (OS), which damages biomolecules and causes mitochondrial and dopamine system dysfunctions, is a persistent finding in patients with BD. Inflammation and immune dysfunction might also play a role in BD pathophysiology. Specific nutrient supplements (nutraceuticals) may target neurobiological pathways suggested to be perturbed in BD, such as inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and OS. Consequently, nutraceuticals may be used in the adjunctive treatment of BD. This paper summarizes the possible roles of OS, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune system dysregulation in the onset of BD. It then discusses OS-mitigating strategies that may serve as therapeutic interventions for BD. It also analyzes the relationship between diet and BD as well as the use of nutritional interventions in the treatment of BD. In addition, it addresses the use of lithium therapy; novel antipsychotic agents, including clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, cariprazine, and quetiapine; and anti-inflammatory agents to treat BD. Furthermore, it reviews the efficacy of the most used therapies for BD, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, imagery-focused cognitive therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. A better understanding of the roles of OS, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder, along with a stronger elucidation of the therapeutic functions of antioxidants, antipsychotics, anti-inflammatory agents, lithium therapy, and light therapies, may lead to improved strategies for the treatment and prevention of bipolar disorder.",20220215,23,3,10.3390/ijms23031844,1422-0067

Several meta-analyses that examine the effectiveness of psychotherapies for patients with bipolar disorder include conclusions about the impact upon bipolar depression. However, these tend not to consider differences in depression outcome depending upon whether the therapy primarily targets acute depression, nor severity of baseline depression. This may affect the conclusions drawn about the effectiveness of these therapies for acute bipolar depression treatment. OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis explored the effectiveness of psychological therapies in reducing bipolar depression, in particular examining whether: (1) the effect of therapy is greater when baseline depressive symptoms are more severe, and (2) the effect of therapy is greater when the primary focus of the therapy is the treatment of acute bipolar depression? DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted using the following electronic databases; Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (1996), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), PsycINFO (1974 onwards), Scopus, Web of Science and Clinical Trials Registries (listed at:https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/international/clinical-trial-registries/index.html). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating a psychological intervention for adults diagnosed with Bipolar I or II disorder. The comparators were usual care, wait-list, placebo, active treatment control. Post-treatment depression status was required to be measured continuously using a validated self- or observer- report measure, or categorically by a validated diagnostic instrument or clinical diagnosis by a suitably qualified person. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full texts. Two reviewers conducted each stage until agreement was reached, and both independently extracted study information. Means, standard deviations (SDs) and number of participants were retrieved from articles and used to perform a meta-analysis. The primary outcome was depressive symptom score. RESULTS: The database search identified 6388 studies. After removing the duplicates, 3298 studies remained, of which, 28 studies were included in the qualitative review and 22 in the meta-analysis. Effect sizes range from -1.99 [-2.50, -1.49] to 0.89 [-0.12, 1.90]. There was low quality evidence of a significant effect on symptoms of depression for cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. Trials of psychoeducation, mindfulness-based therapy, family therapy and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy showed no evidence of any effect on depression. We found no significant relationship between baseline depression score and depression outcome post-treatment when we controlled for therapy type and comparator. The result also showed that the effect sizes for studies targeting acute depression to be tightly clustered around a small overall effect size. CONCLUSIONS: Some psychological therapies may reduce acute bipolar depression although this conclusion should be viewed with caution given the low quality of evidence. More research using similar therapy types and comparators is needed to better understand the relationship between depression status at baseline and outcome.",20220110,301,,10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.112,1573-2517

However, few studies have examined this topic in youth. Thus, we aimed to examine the association of lithium and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), the first-line antimanic medications for youth with BD, with neurocognition in a relatively large sample of youth with BD. Methods: Participants included 91 youth with BD-I, -II, or -Not Otherwise Specified, aged 13-20 years (n = 14 current lithium use, n = 51 current SGA use). We examined four tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery: Intra/Extra Dimensional Set-Shifting Task (IED), Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP), Stockings of Cambridge Test (SOC), and Affective Go/No-Go (AGN). Within-sample Z-scores were computed, and a global neurocognitive composite score and g factor derived from these tests comprised the primary outcomes. Multivariable analyses controlled for age, sex, and IQ. Results: Current lithium use was significantly associated with poorer cognitive flexibility/set-shifting (IED). After further controlling for lifetime comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and current depression symptoms in sensitivity analyses, the lithium finding was no longer significant. Current SGA use was significantly associated with greater affective processing bias (AGN). No significant findings survived correction for multiple comparisons. All other cognitive outcomes were not significantly associated with current lithium use, current SGA use, or total number of current medications. Conclusions: Treatment with lithium or SGAs was associated with minimal neurocognitive impairments, with small effect sizes in primary multivariable analyses. This study adds to the limited body of literature examining medication use in relation to neurocognition in youth with BD. While the current study cannot rule out associations of smaller effect size, present findings suggest that leading mood-stabilizing medications are not associated with frank neurocognitive impairments in youth with BD.",20220127,32,1,10.1089/cap.2021.0093,1557-8992

METHODS: Randomised and non-randomised studies of interventions for bipolar disorder that included an assessment of childhood trauma were eligible. MEDLINE Complete, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Two independent reviewers completed the screening and extraction process. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Alongside a narrative synthesis, random-effects meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Twelve studies (1175 participants) were included. The narrative review highlighted differential treatment outcomes among individuals with a history of childhood trauma. The meta-analyses suggested that childhood trauma was unrelated to treatment response (five studies, 426 participants; odds ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.27-1.25, p = .164) but may be associated with greater improvement in global functioning (three studies, 210 participants; Hedge's g 0.65, 95% CI 0.04-1.26, p = .037). LIMITATIONS: The impact of childhood trauma on the effectiveness of specific pharmacological/psychological interventions could not be explored due to the small body of research identified. CONCLUSION: The overall quality of the extant evidence is low, which precludes definitive comment on the role of childhood trauma in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Additional research that uses large and representative samples is required to ascertain whether a history of childhood trauma affects the treatment outcomes of interventions for individuals with bipolar disorder.",20211004,296,,10.1016/j.jad.2021.09.103,1573-2517

Second, we systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of BWMIs in adults with SMI. Data on the characteristics that promoted engagement and weight outcomes were extracted. We then used a crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis (CsQCA) to identify which characteristics were associated with weight loss. For the qualitative review, 20 studies in 515 people with SMI were analyzed and nine characteristics were reported to promote engagement in BWMIs. For the systematic review, 34 RCTs testing 36 interventions in 4305 participants were included. The active interventions resulted in more weight loss (mean = -4.37 to +1 kg at 6 weeks to 18 months follow-up) compared with controls (-1.64 to +3.08 kg). The CsQCA showed BWMIs that offered regular contact, tools to support enactment, and tailored materials were associated with effectiveness.

Erin was born at full term. Her birth history was significant for reported maternal treatment for liver failure during pregnancy. Her previous medical history included hospitalization for a viral illness at age 2 months, recurrent ear infections, and a fractured forearm. Family history was significant for a maternal history of bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and concern for substance abuse; a paternal history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression; and full biological brother with a history of ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder. Erin and her brother lived with their parents until she was approximately 3 years old. At that time, there were concerns for poor hygiene, inconsistent medical care, poor school attendance for her brother, financial instability, and significant neglect. Erin was reportedly confined to her crib for hours at a time. She and her older brother were removed from the home because of concerns for significant neglect and placed into foster care. Approximately 3 months after foster placement, Erin underwent testing because of concerns for abnormal behaviors and possible developmental delays. Symptoms included poor sleep, repetitive behaviors such as head banging, delayed speech that primarily involved grunting, and lack of toilet training. She was hyperactive and aggressive and had poor caregiver attachment. On evaluation, she was small for age, poorly groomed, and easily distracted with poor eye contact and did not tolerate interactions with examiners. Neuropsychological testing consisted of symptom checklists and caregiver interview only because she did not tolerate diagnostic testing. She was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and global developmental delay with intellectual and language impairments. Over the following year, Erin was transitioned to a second foster family and was subsequently adopted. She received speech, occupational, and physical therapy, along with trauma-informed therapy. She made significant gains in multiple domains and was able to graduate from trauma-informed therapy after 1 year. On examination, Erin greets you with appropriate eye contact and reports that she is feeling "good." She is verbal and interactive with her brother and parents. She looks to parents for support when asked to participate in the physical examination. She does not display any significant repetitive behaviors. Erin's parents are concerned that her initial diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and global developmental delay do not accurately reflect her current level of functioning and are afraid she may have been misdiagnosed.

We explored the relevance of recommended definitions of clinically significant cognitive impairment for functional outcomes, estimated its prevalence, and identified patient characteristics associated with cognition. Methods We assessed cognitive performance across four domains in 80 euthymic participants with BD. Participants were categorized based on two criteria for clinically significant cognitive impairment and we assessed the ability of these criteria to differentiate participant performance on established functional outcomes. Variable selection with elastic net regression was used to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with cognitive performance. Selected variables were examined as predictors of clinically significant cognitive impairment with logistic regression. Results According to the selected criterion, 34% presented with clinically significant cognitive impairment. Poorer current cognitive performance was associated with older age, lower estimated premorbid IQ, more currently prescribed psychotropic medications, fewer previous psychological therapies, and current use of antipsychotics. A model with premorbid IQ, psychotropic medications and previous psychological therapies as predictors of cognitive impairment correctly classified 75% of the participants. Conclusions This is one of the first studies to use a model selection approach to identify factors associated with cognitive difficulties in BD. Our findings offer the initial steps towards a predictive model for cognitive impairment. This could improve treatment decisions and prioritization for euthymic patients with BD, particularly the implementation of cognitive interventions.",20210730,294,,10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.036,1573-2517

This systematic literature review described randomized control trials of psychosocial smoking cessation interventions for people with SMI, rated their methodological rigor, evaluated the inclusion of racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities, and examined smoking cessation outcomes. Methods: Eligible studies included peer-reviewed articles published between 2009 and 2020 that examined psychosocial smoking cessation interventions in people with SMI. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis guidelines to conduct our review and the Methodological Quality Rating Scale to evaluate methodological rigor. Results: Eighteen studies were included. Ten were categorized as high methodological rigor given their study characteristics (e.g., longer follow-up) and eight as lower methodological rigor based on their characteristics (e.g., not intent-to-treat). Racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities were under-represented in these studies. A range of psychosocial interventions were examined including motivational enhancements, smoking cessation education, cognitive behavioral strategies, and contingency management. Most studies also provided smoking cessation medications (e.g., NRT, bupropion), although provision was not always uniform across treatment conditions. Three studies found the intervention condition achieved significantly higher abstinence from smoking compared to the comparison group. Seven studies found the intervention condition achieved significantly higher reductions in smoking compared to the comparison group. Conclusions: Studies finding significant differences between the intervention and comparison groups shared common evidenced-based components, including providing smoking cessation medications (e.g., NRT, bupropion), motivational enhancement techniques, and cessation education and skills training, but differed in intensity (e.g., number and frequency of sessions), duration, and modality (e.g., group, individual, technology). Methodological limitations and a small number of studies finding significant between-group differences prevent the identification of the most effective psychosocial smoking cessation interventions. Clinical trial designs (e.g., SMART, factorial) that control for the provision of psychosocial medications and allow for the identification of optimal psychosocial treatments are needed. Future studies should also ensure greater inclusion of racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities and should be culturally/linguistically adapted to improve treatment engagement and study outcomes.",20210720,17,3,10.1080/15504263.2021.1944712,1550-4271

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 172 BD patients aged &#8805;50 years. Demographics, psychiatric characteristics and psychotropic medication use were collected using self-report questionnaires and structured interviews. The presence of cardiovascular risk factors was determined by combining information from structured interviews, physical examination and laboratory assessments. Cognitive performance was investigated by an extensive neuropsychological assessment of 13 tests, covering the domains of attention, learning/ memory, verbal fluency and executive functioning. The average of 13 neuropsychological test Z-scores resulted in a composite cognitive score. A linear multiple regression model was created using forward selection with the composite cognitive score as outcome variable. Domain cognitive scores were used as secondary outcome variables. RESULTS: The final multivariable model (N = 125), which controlled for age and education level, included number of depressive episodes, number of (hypo)manic episodes, late onset, five or more psychiatric admissions, lifetime smoking, metabolic syndrome and current use of benzodiazepines. Together, these determinants explained 43.0% of the variance in composite cognitive score. Late onset and number of depressive episodes were significantly related to better cognitive performance whereas five or more psychiatric admissions and benzodiazepine use were significantly related to worse cognitive performance. CONCLUSION: Psychiatric characteristics, cardiovascular risk and benzodiazepine use are related to cognitive performance in OABD. Cognitive variability in OABD thus seems multifactorial.

METHODS: 275 treatment-seeking individuals with AUD and other SUDs were consecutively admitted to a 3-month DBT-ST program (in- + outpatient; outpatient settings). The machine learning routine applied (i.e. penalized regression combined with a nested cross-validation procedure) was conducted in order to estimate predictive values of a wide panel of clinical variables in a single statistical framework on drop-out and substance-use behaviors, dealing with related multicollinearity, and eliminating redundant variables. RESULTS: The cross-validated elastic net model significantly predicted the drop-out. The bootstrap analysis revealed that subjects who showed substance-use behaviors during the intervention and who were treated with the mixed setting (i.e., in- and outpatient) program, together with higher ASI alcohol scores were associated with an higher probability of drop-out. On the contrary, older subjects, higher levels of education, together with higher scores of DERS awareness subscale were negatively associated to drop-out. Similarly, lifetime co-diagnoses of anxiety, bipolar, and gambling disorders, together with bulimia nervosa negatively predicted the drop-out. The machine learning model did not identify predictive variables of substance-use behaviors during the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The DBT-ST program could be considered a valid therapeutic approach especially when AUD and other SUDs co-occur with other psychiatric conditions and, it is carried out as a full outpatient intervention.",20210509,224,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108723,1879-0046

Regarding preferential outcomes, one study found that older youth respond better to lithium than younger youth; all youth, regardless of age, respond similarly to valproate. One study found non-obese youth and those with comorbid attention deficit hyper-activity disorder respond better to risperidone than lithium. Results are mixed for psychosis and disruptive behavior disorders on risperidone compared to divalproex. Tentatively, youth with generalized anxiety are more likely to respond to valproate while youth with panic preferentially respond to lithium. Psychotherapy findings from two studies suggest that sex, age, race, baseline mania, and past-month suicidal ideation/non-suicidal self-injury do not moderate outcomes. Although not replicated, higher baseline inflammatory markers are associated with greater decreases in depressive symptoms; baseline higher self-esteem and comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are associated with steeper decreases in (hypo)manic symptoms.Conclusions: Findings are mixed on the role of baseline mood severity, other comorbid disorders, parental depression, family income, and expressed emotion in moderating treatment outcomes.

However, iCBT programmes include training in a wide array of cognitive and behavioural skills via different delivery methods, and it remains unclear which of these components are more efficacious and for whom. METHODS: We did a systematic review and individual participant data component network meta-analysis (cNMA) of iCBT trials for depression. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to Jan 1, 2019, that compared any form of iCBT against another or a control condition in the acute treatment of adults (aged &#8805;18 years) with depression. Studies with inpatients or patients with bipolar depression were excluded. We sought individual participant data from the original authors. When these data were unavailable, we used aggregate data. Two independent researchers identified the included components. The primary outcome was depression severity, expressed as incremental mean difference (iMD) in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores when a component is added to a treatment. We developed a web app that estimates relative efficacies between any two combinations of components, given baseline patient characteristics. This study is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42018104683. FINDINGS: We identified 76 RCTs, including 48 trials contributing individual participant data (11 704 participants) and 28 trials with aggregate data (6474 participants). The participants' weighted mean age was 42·0 years and 12 406 (71%) of 17 521 reported were women. There was suggestive evidence that behavioural activation might be beneficial (iMD -1·83 [95% credible interval (CrI) -2·90 to -0·80]) and that relaxation might be harmful (1·20 [95% CrI 0·17 to 2·27]). Baseline severity emerged as the strongest prognostic factor for endpoint depression. Combining human and automated encouragement reduced dropouts from treatment (incremental odds ratio, 0·32 [95% CrI 0·13 to 0·93]). The risk of bias was low for the randomisation process, missing outcome data, or selection of reported results in most of the included studies, uncertain for deviation from intended interventions, and high for measurement of outcomes. There was moderate to high heterogeneity among the studies and their components. INTERPRETATION: The individual patient data cNMA revealed potentially helpful, less helpful, or harmful components and delivery formats for iCBT packages. iCBT packages aiming to be effective and efficient might choose to include beneficial components and exclude ones that are potentially detrimental. Our web app can facilitate shared decision making by therapist and patient in choosing their preferred iCBT package.

However, little is known about the brain mechanisms of beneficial outcomes from this intervention. Herein, we aimed to investigate the network-level neurofunctional effects of MBCT-C in mood dysregulated adolescents. METHODS: Ten mood dysregulated adolescents at familial risk for BD underwent a 12-week MBCT-C intervention. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed prior to and following MBCT-C. Topological metrics of three intrinsic functional networks (default mode network (DMN), fronto-parietal network (FPN) and cingulo-opercular network (CON)) were investigated respectively using graph theory analysis. RESULTS: Following MBCT-C, mood dysregulated adolescents showed increased global efficiency and decreased characteristic path length within both CON and FPN. Enhanced functional connectivity strength of frontal and limbic areas were identified within the DMN and CON. Moreover, change in characteristic path length within the CON was suggested to be significantly related to change in the Emotion Regulation Checklist score. CONCLUSIONS: 12-week MBCT-C treatment in mood dysregulated adolescents at familial risk for BD yield network-level neurofunctional effects within the FPN and CON, suggesting enhanced functional integration of the dual-network. Decreased characteristic path length of the CON may be associated with the improvement of emotion regulation following mindfulness training. However, current findings derived from small sample size should be interpreted with caution. Future randomized controlled trials including larger samples are critical to validate our findings.",20210429,21,1,10.1186/s12888-021-03211-4,1471-244X

Exposure-based, cognitive-behavioral approaches have received ample research, but other PTSD therapies require further empirical attention. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) targets affective awareness, life circumstances, and social support. IPT has shown efficacy for civilians with PTSD but awaits rigorous testing among military personnel; only two small military pilot studies and two case reports have been published. Military family members have received minimal attention from clinical outcomes research. Addressing these gaps, this open trial examined IPT for PTSD among veterans, service members, and family members, including a patient subset with comorbid PTSD and depression. METHODS: Fifty U.S. military service members, veterans, and family members (age &#8805;18 years) were offered 14 sessions of IPT for PTSD. Individuals with psychosis, bipolar disorder, moderate or severe substance use disorders, or high suicide risk were excluded. PTSD and depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Clinician-assessed PTSD (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale) and depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) symptoms decreased over time in the full sample and the comorbid PTSD/depression subset (p<0.05). Service members, veterans, and family members had similar treatment responses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving IPT showed reductions in PTSD and depressive symptoms.

This study aimed to assess the effect of Action-Based Cognitive Remediation (ABCR) vs control treatment on cognitive impairment in patients with BD. METHODS: Patients with remitted BD with objective cognitive impairment were randomized to 10 weeks of ABCR vs control treatment, and assessed at baseline, after 2 weeks of treatment, at treatment completion and at 6 months follow-up. The primary outcome was a cognitive composite score. Secondary outcomes were executive function and observer-rated functional capacity. Tertiary measures included additional neuropsychological tests, performance-based functional capacity and quality of life. Data were analysed with linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: In total, 64 participants were randomized; given three dropouts before the baseline assessments, data were analysed for 61 participants (ABCR: n = 32, control: n = 29). There was no effect on ABCR vs control on the primary cognitive composite score (P-values &#8805;.60). At treatment completion, there was a large effect of ABCR vs control on the secondary executive function measure (treatment effect= -0.16, 95% CI [-0.27, -0.05], P &#8804; .01, d = 0.65), and on subjective cognitive functioning (treatment effect = -5.38, 95% CI [-8.13, -2.67], P &#8804; .001, d = 0.80), which disappeared at follow-up. There was no treatment-effect on functioning, and no association between cognitive and functional change. CONCLUSIONS: There was no effect of ABCR on the cognitive composite score.

Extensive research has demonstrated CRT to improve cognition and psychosocial functioning in people with different diagnoses, but randomised trials of evidenced therapy programmes are lacking for bipolar disorders. The Cognitive Remediation in Bipolar (CRiB) study aimed to determine whether an established CRT programme is feasible and acceptable for people with bipolar disorders. METHODS: This proof-of-concept, single-blind randomised trial recruited participants aged 18-65 with bipolar disorder, not currently experiencing an episode. They were 1:1 block randomised to treatment-as-usual (TAU) with or without individual CRT for 12 weeks. The partly computerised CRT programme (CIRCuiTS) was therapist-led and is evidence-based from trials in those with psychotic illnesses. Data were collected and analysed by investigators blinded to group allocation. The main outcomes (week 13 and 25) examined participant retention, intervention feasibility and putative effects of CRT on cognitive and psychosocial functioning via intention-to-treat analyses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN ID32290525. RESULTS: Sixty participants were recruited (02/2016-06/2018) and randomised to CRT (n = 29) or TAU (n = 31). Trial withdrawals were equivalent (CRT n = 2/29; TAU n = 5/31). CRT satisfaction indicated high acceptability. Intention-to-treat analyses (N = 60) demonstrated greater improvements for CRT- than TAU-randomised participants: at both week 13 and 25, CIRCuiTS participants showed larger improvements in the following domains (week 25 effect sizes reported here): IQ (SES = 0.71, 95% CI [0.29,1.13]), working memory (SES = 0.70, 95% CI [0.31,1.10]), executive function (SES = 0.93, 95% CI [0.33,1.54]), psychosocial functioning (SES = 0.49, 95% CI [0.18,0.80]) and goal attainment (SES = 2.02, 95% CI [0.89,3.14]).

This highlights a pressing clinical need to identify novel effective anxiety treatments. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence within the field. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search on PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) targeting anxiety in remitted BD patients. RESULTS: We identified 10 RCTs investigating the effects of psychological or pharmacological treatments on anxiety in remitted BD patients. Two studies of transdiagnostic personalised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) found a treatment-related reduction in anxiety. This evidence was preliminary given small sample size and use of self-report measures in a single-blind trial design, respectively. The remaining six psychological intervention trials provided more preliminary evidence due to several methodological challenges. The two pharmacological studies found anxiolytic effects of add-on olanzapine or methylene blue to lithium treatment, respectively. Nevertheless, this evidence should be interpreted with caution given high drop-out rates and substantial side-effects that may have impeded blinding. LIMITATIONS: We did not conduct a quantitative meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There is preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of modified CBT and add-on pharmacotherapy on residual anxiety in BD. Future trials should pre-screen participants for anxiety, define one clinician-rated anxiety measurement as a primary outcome, and employ intention-to-treat analysis to assess treatment effect. This will advance treatment development and enable personalised approaches to address residual anxiety in BD, which has great clinical relevance.",20201010,279,,10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.119,1573-2517

Long-term prescription of benzodiazepines in bipolar disorder is a common practice, and their effect on neurocognition has not been well studied in this population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of concomitant benzodiazepine long-term use on neurocognitive function in stable euthymic bipolar disorder patients. METHODS: Seventy-three euthymic bipolar disorder outpatients and 40 healthy individuals were assessed using a neurocognitive battery. Patients were classified in two groups according to the presence of benzodiazepines in their treatment: the benzodiazepine group (n = 34) and the non- benzodiazepine group (n = 39). Neurocognitive performance was compared between the groups using a multivariate analysis of covariance, considering age, number of depressive episodes, adjuvant antipsychotic drugs, Young Mania Rating Scale score and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score as covariates. RESULTS: Both bipolar disorder groups (benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine) showed an impairment in memory domains (Immediate Visual Memory [p = 0.013], Working Memory [p < 0.001], and Letter-Number Sequence [p < 0.001] from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised-III) and slower processing speed functions (Stroop Colour [p < 0.001]) relative to the control group. Nevertheless, the benzodiazepine group showed a greater impairment in executive functions (Conceptual Level Responses [p = 0.024] from the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Frontal Assessment Battery [p = 0.042]). CONCLUSION: Although memory and processing speed impairments were found in bipolar disorder, regardless of their benzodiazepine treatment, benzodiazepine users presented additional neurocognitive impairments in terms of executive functioning.

This qualitative study aimed to investigate participants' experiences of trial involvement, and the acceptability of CBT for this population. DESIGN: Participants were those identified as being at risk of bipolar disorder, determined by current symptoms or family history. A purposive sample of twenty-one participants from both the intervention and TAU arms of the trial was recruited. METHODS: Twenty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted by service user researchers (13 participants had received therapy and 8 TAU). Interviews were audio recorded with consent from participants and transcribed verbatim. NVivo 11 Pro software was used to conduct an inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Super-ordinate themes were adaptability and flexibility,feeling understood and valued, and relevance of study and intervention which had two sub-themes-value of the trial therapy and acceptability of trial processes. Participating in the trial and having therapy enabled participants to feel understood and valued by research assistants (RAs) and therapists. Participants viewed therapy as relevant to their current concerns and valued adaptability and flexibility of RAs and therapists. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the importance and value of flexibility, adaptability, and understanding in relationships between participants and trial staff. Findings also indicate that the trial processes and CBT focusing on mood swings are acceptable and relevant to participants from this at risk population. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Young people at risk of bipolar disorder value a flexible approach to assessments and therapy, developing a rapport with research assistants and therapists and opening up to them when they feel comfortable to do so. CBT focusing on coping with mood swings was acceptable to the majority of participants who received it and it was perceived as helpful in ways that were personal to each participant.",20201016,94,3,10.1111/papt.12313,2044-8341

Typically, bipolar disorders onset during adolescence or early adulthood, with patients experiencing significant personal and social costs as a consequence of their illness. Despite this, to date, there is limited (controlled) evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychotherapy during the critical stages of the disorder (e.g., early onset). Some preliminary studies suggest that targeted, tailored early interventions in particular may improve disease prognosis. The proposed study examines the effectiveness of group psychotherapy on relapse prevention, global adaptive functioning, and neuropsychological functioning in early-stage bipolar disorder. METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT), 300 patients with bipolar disorder are randomized to one of two group psychotherapies: Specific Emotional-Cognitive Therapy (SECT; intervention group) or Emotion-Focused Supportive Therapy (EFST; active control group). Each therapy comprises of a total of 48-h sessions (delivered once a month) over a period of 4 months. Assessments take place at baseline (t1); 6 months follow-up, i.e., post-intervention (t2); 12 months follow-up (t3); and 18 months follow-up (t4), whereby 18 months follow-up is the primary time point of interest. DISCUSSION: The goal of this study is to test the effects of an innovative, specific group therapy relative to an active control condition in terms of rates of relapse, global functioning, and neuropsychological functioning. Pending the outcomes of the trial, it will be possible to establish a firm evidence base for accessible group psychotherapy adjuvant to routine psychiatric care for individuals with bipolar disorder.

Methods: From December 2018 to January 2019, a graphic depiction of medications and weekly ratings of symptoms of mania, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and oppositional behavior that parents had rated on their 9-year-old child over a period of several years was sent to experts in child and adult bipolar disorder. These responding medical doctors (MDs, 8 child and 18 adult psychiatrists) rated a comprehensive list of medications that they would choose (and with what priority) to treat the child's now improved mood (mania and depression) but continued mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety, ADHD, and oppositional behavior. Results: In the whole group, the drugs most highly endorsed were lamotrigine: 69%, lithium: 62%, lurasidone: 62%, quetiapine: 54%, aripiprazole: 46%, and valproate: 42%. Among the antidepressants, 38% endorsed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, 12% a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and 27% bupropion. Of the child MDs, 75% suggested increasing the 1-mg dose of risperidone, while few adult MDs suggested this. Conversely, 56% of the adult MDs suggested using valproate, while only 1 child MD did so. There was little consensus on how to manage ADHD symptoms unresponsive to methylphenidate 36 mg/d. How these treatment options were sequenced also varied widely. Conclusions: There was wide variation in suggestions on to how to treat persistent symptoms of anxiety, ADHD, and oppositional behavior in a child whose mania and depression had been brought under good control. We surmise that this great diversity in recommendations among experts in child and adult bipolar disorder stems at least partially from inadequate literature on treatment and that a new emphasis on funding and conducting studies on efficacy and effectiveness is needed.",20200917,22,5,10.4088/PCC.19m02574,2155-7780

Autobiographical memory (AM) could be involved in cognitive reactivity, and improved with MBCT training. This study aims to investigate the effect of MBCT for bipolar patients on depressive and anxious symptoms, dysfunctional attitudes and AM, and the predictive versus mediating role of AM in the impact of MBCT on clinical symptoms. METHODS: Sixty-two outpatients diagnosed with bipolar I disorder were assigned to MBCT and were compared to 37 bipolar patients on a waiting list. Affective symptoms and dysfunctional attitudes were explored using self-report inventories (BDI, BAI, DAS) and AM was assessed using the Autobiographical Memory Test. RESULTS: Patients receiving MBCT demonstrated significantly decreased depressive symptoms, dysfunctional attitudes, overgeneral memories and omissions, and increased specific memories. General AM and omissions at baseline respectively predicted lower anxiety and dysfunctional attitudes improvement following therapy, but the improvement of AM did not explain the impact of MBCT on depression and dysfunctional attitudes improvement. LIMITS: Further studies should consider patients' therapeutic adherence and mechanisms involved in MBCT in order to better apprehend how MBCT may reduce dysfunctional attitudes and improve AM in bipolar patients. CONCLUSION: Results are consistent with the hypothesis that MBCT reduces cognitive reactivity and AM impairment in bipolar disorders. Findings suggest that AM training prior to MBCT may influence MBCT efficacy, but that MBCT efficacy on AM and clinical symptoms are non-related phenomena.",20200803,276,,10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.072,1573-2517

Cognitive remediation (CR) is considered an effective add-on intervention for neuropsychological impairments, but relatively few CR controlled studies have been performed on BD. In the present study the efficacy of a CR intervention designed for the improvement of cognition and functioning in patients with euthymic BD was tested. METHODS: Patients (n = 54) with euthymic BD were assigned to receive active (n = 27) or control (n = 27) intervention. The active intervention (i.e. the Cognitive Remediation in Integrated Treatment - CRIIT - protocol) was made of 20 individual sessions focused on the treatment of attention, memory and executive functioning through the COGPACK software; each session was integrated with psychoeducation and rehabilitation interventions implemented through a metacognitive approach aimed at ameliorating personal agency. RESULTS: A significant (p &#8804; 0.015) time x group interaction at repeated measures MANOVA was observed on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Rey Complex Figure Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Trail Making Test, Visual Search, Life Skills Profile, and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. LIMITATIONS: A single-blind approach was used. DISCUSSION: The results showed that patients undergoing active intervention improved in domains related to executive functions, attention, memory, functioning and impulsivity more significantly than patients undergoing control interventions. This study adds to the evidence that CR improves neurocognition in BD, and suggests that CRIIT protocol represents an add-on intervention of potential relevance to increase cognition and functioning in BD euthymic patients.",20200621,273,,10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.073,1573-2517

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the general efficacy of MBCT for BD. METHODS: Ten studies were identified that fulfilled the current inclusion criteria, including three controlled and seven uncontrolled studies. The effects of MBCT on depression, anxiety, mania, stress, mindfulness ability, and emotional regulation were assessed by comparing psychometric scale scores within groups (pre- vs. post-intervention) across trials as well as between groups (control vs. MBCT) across controlled trials. RESULTS: Within-group comparison revealed a reduction in symptoms of depression (gâ¯=â¯0.37, 95%CIâ¯=â¯0.09-0.64, Pâ¯=â¯0.009) and anxiety (gâ¯=â¯0.45, 95%CI =0.16-0.75, Pâ¯=â¯0.002) following treatment compared to baseline. Stress symptoms were also significantly reduced (gâ¯=â¯0.39, 95%CIâ¯=â¯0.09-0.69, Pâ¯=â¯0.01), mindfulness ability (gâ¯=â¯0.63, 95%CIâ¯=â¯0.39-0.87, P<0.00001) and emotion regulation (gâ¯=â¯0.62, 95%CI=0.14-1.10, Pâ¯=â¯0.01) were significantly improved compared to baseline. However, symptoms of mania were not alleviated (g=-0.26, 95%CI=-1.43-0.91, Pâ¯=â¯0.66). Subgroup analysis indicated that symptoms of depression and anxiety were still significantly improved at 3 months post-intervention (gâ¯=â¯0.46, 95%CIâ¯=â¯0.13-0.80, Pâ¯=â¯0.006 and gâ¯=â¯0.57, 95%CIâ¯=â¯0.21-0.94, Pâ¯=â¯0.002, respectively) but not at 12 months (gâ¯=â¯0.04, 95%CIâ¯=â¯-0.29-0.37, Pâ¯=â¯0.82 and gâ¯=â¯0.17, 95%CI =-0.16-0.50, Pâ¯=â¯0.31). In between-groups analysis of controlled studies, MBCT significantly reduced depressive symptoms (gâ¯=â¯0.3, 95%CI =-0.05-0.65, Pâ¯=â¯0.09) but not anxiety symptoms (gâ¯=â¯0.51, 95%CIâ¯=â¯ -0.20-1.22, Pâ¯=â¯0.16). CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy appears effective for alleviation of depression and anxiety among BD patients, possibly by improving emotional regulation and mindfulness abilities. However, efficacy appears time-limited and inconsistent, necessitating additional larger-scale studies and the development of post-intervention programs for sustained efficacy.",20200602,290,,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113116,1872-7123

Intrusive mental images are highly disruptive, drive emotion, and contribute to maintaining psychopathology. Cognitive science suggests that we might target intrusive images using competing tasks. AIMS: We describe an imagery competing task technique within cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with a patient with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The intervention - including Tetris computer game-play - was used (1) to target a specific image within one therapy session, and (2) to manage multiple images in daily life. METHOD: A single case (AB) design was used. (1) To target a specific image, the patient brought the image to mind and, after mental rotation instructions and game-play practice, played Tetris for 10 minutes. Outcomes, pre- and post-technique, were: vividness/distress ratings when the image was brought to mind; reported intrusion frequency over a week. (2) To manage multiple images, the patient used the intervention after an intrusive image occurred. Outcomes were weekly measures of: (a) imagery characteristics; (b) symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression and mania. RESULTS: (1) For the target image, there were reductions in vividness (80% to 40%), distress (70% to 0%), and intrusion frequency (daily to twice/week). (2) For multiple images, there were reductions from baseline to follow-up in (a) imagery vividness (38%), realness (66%) and compellingness (23%), and (b) PTSD symptoms (Impact of Events Scale-Revised score 26.33 to 4.83). CONCLUSION: This low-intensity intervention aiming to directly target intrusive mental imagery may offer an additional, complementary tool in CBT.",20200630,48,6,10.1017/S1352465820000296,1469-1833

A recent study evaluated integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy for bipolar disorder and alcohol misuse with promising results in terms of the feasibility of delivering the therapy and the acceptability to participants. AIMS: Here we present the experiences of the therapists and supervisors from the trial to identify the key challenges in working with this client group and how these might be overcome. METHOD: Four therapists and two supervisors participated in a focus group. Topic guides for the group were informed by a summary of challenges and obstacles that each therapist had completed at the end of therapy for each individual client. The audio recording of the focus group was transcribed and data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: We identified five themes: addressing alcohol use versus other problems; impact of bipolar disorder on therapy; importance of avoidance and overcoming it; fine balance in relation to shame and normalising use; and 'talking the talk' versus 'walking the walk'. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that clients may be willing to explore motivations for using alcohol even if they are not ready to change their drinking, and they may want help with a range of mental health problems. Emotional and behavioural avoidance may be a key factor in maintaining alcohol use in this client group and therapists should be aware of a possible discrepancy between clients' intentions to reduce misuse and their actual behaviour.",20200507,48,5,10.1017/S1352465820000272,1469-1833

The development of CBT for this disorder is relatively under-explored. METHOD: Participants with bipolar I or II disorder were treated with group CBT in addition to treatment as usual. The effectiveness of the protocol was explored through sequence analysis of daily mood monitoring prior to, during and after the intervention. Also, a repeated measures design was used assessing symptomatology, dysfunctional attitudes, sense of mastery, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life at start and end of intervention, and at follow-up 2 and 12 months later. RESULTS: The results indicate that variation in mood states diminished over the course of the intervention. Also, there was a change from depressive states to more euthymic states. Greater number of reported lifetime depressive episodes was associated with greater diversity of mood states. There was an increase in overall psychosocial functioning and self-reported psychological health following the intervention. Improvement continued after treatment ended until follow-up at 2 months, and measured 1 year later, for outcomes representing depression, general psychosocial functioning and self-reported psychological health. Due to small sample size and the lack of a control group the results are preliminary. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study suggest that both offering CBT in group interventions and sequence analysis of time series data are helpful routes to further explore when improving standard CBT interventions for patients suffering from bipolar disorder.",20200423,48,5,10.1017/S1352465820000259,1469-1833

In the present study, we aim to methodically test the effects of lithium on neurocognitive functioning in the largest single cohort (n = 262) of BD patients reported to date by harnessing the power of a multi-site, ongoing clinical trial of lithium monotherapy. At the cross-sectional level, multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was conducted to examine potential group differences across neurocognitive tests [California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT trials 1-5,CVLT delayed recall), Wechsler Digit Symbol, Trail-making Test parts A and B (TMT-A; TMT-B), and a global cognition index]. At the longitudinal level, on a subset of patients (n = 88) who achieved mood stabilization with lithium monotherapy, we explored the effect of lithium treatment across time on neurocognitive functioning.

Patients with clinically significant symptoms fulfilling at-risk criteria for serious mental illness (SMI) require effective and safe treatment. Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) has shown promising results in early stages of BD and in patients at high risk for psychosis. We aimed to investigate whether group CBT can improve symptoms and functional deficits in young patients at risk for SMI presenting with subthreshold bipolar symptoms. METHOD: In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, patients at clinical risk for SMI presenting with subthreshold bipolar symptoms aged 15-30 years were randomized to 14 weeks of at-risk for BD-specific group CBT or unstructured group meetings. Primary efficacy endpoints were differences in affective symptomatology and psychosocial functioning at 14 weeks. At-risk status was defined as a combination of subthreshold bipolar symptomatology, reduction of psychosocial functioning and a family history for (schizo)affective disorders. A prespecified interim analysis was conducted at 75% of the targeted sample. RESULTS: Of 128 screened participants, 75 were randomized to group CBT (n = 38, completers = 65.8%) vs unstructured group meetings (n = 37, completers = 78.4%). Affective symptomatology and psychosocial functioning improved significantly at week 14 (P < .001) and during 6 months (P < .001) in both groups, without significant between-group differences. Findings are limited by the interim character of the analysis, the use of not fully validated early detection interviews, a newly adapted intervention manual, and the substantial drop-outs. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that young patients at-risk for SMI presenting with subthreshold bipolar symptoms benefit from early group sessions. The degree of specificity and psychotherapeutic interaction needed requires clarification.",20200301,22,5,10.1111/bdi.12894,1399-5618

Prevention of first and subsequent mood episodes, which are usually preceded by a period characterized by subthreshold symptoms is important. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics including severity and duration of subsyndromal symptoms across adolescents with three different bipolar-spectrum disorders. Methods: Syndromal and subsyndromal psychopathology were assessed in adolescent inpatients (age = 12-18 years) with a clinical mood disorder diagnosis. Assessments included the validated Bipolar Prodrome Symptom Interview and Scale-Prospective (BPSS-P). We compared phenomenology across patients with a research consensus conference-confirmed DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) diagnoses of BD-I, BD-not otherwise specified (NOS), or mood disorder (MD) NOS. Results: Seventy-six adolescents (age = 15.6 ± 1.4 years, females = 59.2%) were included (BD-I = 24; BD-NOS = 29; MD-NOS = 23) in this study. Median baseline global assessment of functioning scale score was 21 (interquartile range = 17-40; between-group p = 0.31). Comorbidity was frequent, and similar across groups, including disruptive behavior disorders (55.5%, p = 0.27), anxiety disorders (40.8%, p = 0.98), and personality disorder traits (25.0%, p = 0.21). Mania symptoms (most frequent: irritability = 93.4%, p = 0.82) and depressive symptoms (most frequent: depressed mood = 81.6%, p = 0.14) were common in all three BD-spectrum groups. Manic and depressive symptoms were more severe in both BD-I and BD-NOS versus MD-NOS (p < 0.0001). Median duration of subthreshold manic symptoms was shorter in MD-NOS versus BD-NOS (11.7 vs. 20.4 weeks, p = 0.002) and substantial in both groups. The most used psychotropics upon discharge were antipsychotics (65.8%; BD-I = 79.2%; BD-NOS = 62.1%; MD-NOS = 56.5%, p = 0.227), followed by mood stabilizers (43.4%; BD-I = 66.7%; BD-NOS = 31.0%; MD-NOS = 34.8%, p = 0.02) and antidepressants (19.7%; BD-I = 20.8%; BD-NOS = 10.3%; MD-NOS = 30.4%). Conclusions: Youth with BD-I, BD-NOS, and MD-NOS experience considerable symptomatology and are functionally impaired, with few differences observed in psychiatric comorbidity and clinical severity. Moreover, youth with BD-NOS and MD-NOS undergo a period with subthreshold manic symptoms, enabling identification and, possibly, preventive intervention of those at risk for developing BD or other affective episodes requiring hospitalization.",20200222,30,4,10.1089/cap.2019.0138,1557-8992

The Audio Recorded Cognitive Screen (ARCS) is a cognitive test instrument with good psychometric properties that places minimal demands on clinicians' time, but until now, it has not been formally evaluated for monitoring cognition in the context of ECT treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the feasibility/utility of using the ARCS in the assessment of depressed patients undergoing ECT. METHODS: Depressed patients undergoing ECT were tested with the ARCS and a comparison instrument, the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), in counterbalance order immediately before any ECT and after the sixth ECT treatment episode. Apathy (Apathy Scale) and depression (Profile of Mood states Short Form) were measured on both occasions. Analyses compared performances on the 2 cognitive instruments and examined for associations with the measures of apathy or depression. RESULTS: Twenty-eight individuals (9 male, 19 female) aged 19 to 84 years underwent testing. Performances on the total ARCS were similar to those on the total RBANS, and both showed decline from baseline to follow-up. The total ARCS and RBANS measures correlated well (r = 0.75, P < 0.001). Neither apathy nor depression scores were significantly associated with scores on either the RBANS or ARCS. CONCLUSIONS: The ARCS was acceptable and convenient in the assessment of cognition in patients undergoing treatment with ECT. In light of its practical advantages, further evaluation of the ARCS for detecting cognitive impairment and tracking cognitive changes during ECT seems warranted.",20200109,36,1,10.1097/YCT.0000000000000637,1533-4112

Participants in the waitlist period received educational materials 12 weeks prior to the beginning of MBCT-C. RESULTS: There were significantly greater improvements in overall clinical severity in the MBCT-C period compared to the waitlist period, but not in clinician- and child-rated anxiety, emotion regulation or mindfulness. However, increases in mindfulness were associated with improvements in anxiety and emotion regulation in the MBCT-C period, but not the waitlist period.

Until recent changes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), irritability was often associated with mood disorders, which may have led to increases in bipolar disorder diagnosis and prescription of mood stabilizing medication. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore differences between the approaches psychiatric and primary care providers use to assess irritability. METHODS: A single trained interviewer conducted detailed interviews and collected demographic data from a homogeneous group of physicians that saturated with a sample size of 17 pediatric, family medicine, and psychiatric providers who evaluate and treat school-aged children. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In general, primary care providers chose to refer children with irritability to mental health specialists when medication management became complex, while the psychiatric providers chose behavior modification and parent education strategies rather than medications. The psychiatric group had a significantly higher caseload mix, prior experience with irritability, and more confidence in their assessment capabilities. There was lack of continuing medical education about irritability in all groups. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study highlights the importance of collaboration between primary care and subspecialties to promote accurate assessment and subsequent treatment of school-aged children with irritability, who can represent a safety concern for self and others. More research is needed to establish an efficient method of assessing and managing irritability in primary care and better utilization of specialists.",20190730,25,2,10.1177/1359104519865591,1461-7021

Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between such neurotransmitters and RSNs in healthy, by reviewing the relevant work on this topic and performing complementary analyses, in order to better understand their physiological link, as well as their alterations in psychiatric disorders. According to the reviewed data, neurotransmitters nuclei diffusively project to subcortical and cortical regions of RSNs. In particular, the dopaminergic substantia nigra (SNc)-related nigrostriatal pathway is structurally and functionally connected with core regions of the SMN, whereas the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-related mesocorticolimbic pathway with core regions of the SN. The serotonergic raphe nuclei (RNi) connections involve regions of the SMN and DMN. Coherently, changes in neurotransmitters activity impact the functional configuration and level of activity of RSNs, as measured by functional connectivity (FC) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations/temporal variability of BOLD signal. Specifically, DA signaling is associated with increase in FC and activity in the SMN (hypothetically via the SNc-related nigrostriatal pathway) and SN (hypothetically via the VTA-related mesocorticolimbic pathway), as well as concurrent decrease in FC and activity in the DMN. By contrast, 5-HT signaling (via the RNi-related pathways) is associated with decrease in SMN activity along with increase in DMN activity. Complementally, our empirical data showed a positive correlation between SNc-related FC and SMN activity, whereas a negative correlation between RNi-related FC and SMN activity (along with tilting of networks balance toward the DMN). According to these data, we hypothesize that the activity of neurotransmitter-related neurons synchronize the low-frequency oscillations within different RSNs regions, thus affecting the baseline level of RSNs activity and their balancing. In our model, DA signaling favors the predominance of SMN-SN activity, whereas 5-HT signaling favors the predominance of DMN activity, manifesting in distinct behavioral patterns. In turn, alterations in neurotransmitters signaling (or its disconnection) may favor a correspondent functional reorganization of RSNs, manifesting in distinct psychopathological states.

The integrative cognitive model of bipolar disorder proposes that extreme appraisals of changes to internal states maintain and exacerbate mood symptoms. AIMS: The current study aimed to investigate if post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is related to current depressive and manic bipolar symptoms, and whether this relationship is mediated by appraisals of internal state. METHOD: Participants with bipolar disorder (n = 82) from a randomized controlled trial of cognitive therapy for bipolar disorder (the TEAMS trial) completed self-reported questionnaires assessing appraisals of internal state, generalized anxiety symptoms, and self-reported and observer-rated depressive and manic symptoms. Clinical interviews assessed PTSD co-morbidity. RESULTS: Participants with bipolar and co-morbid PTSD (n = 27) had higher depressive symptoms and more conflicting appraisals than those without PTSD. Regression analyses found PTSD to be associated with depressive symptoms but not manic symptoms. Conflicting appraisals were found to be associated only with manic symptoms meaning that the planned mediation analysis could not be completed. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide partial support for the integrative cognitive model of bipolar disorder and highlight the need for transdiagnostic treatments in bipolar disorder due to the prevalence and impact of trauma and co-morbidity. Working on trauma experiences in therapy may impact on depressive symptoms for those with bipolar disorder and co-morbid PTSD.",20191023,48,1,10.1017/S1352465819000572,1469-1833

Although the research on GD has been rising over the years, approved treatment guidelines are currently not available. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on the pharmacological and psychosocial treatment of adults with GD, and to identify possible agreed-upon standards of care. METHODS: MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL electronic databases were searched up to April 2019 for systematic reviews on pharmacological, psychosocial, and combined treatment of adults with GD. Twenty-six studies were eventually included in this meta-review. RESULTS: Studies reported promising results of opioid antagonists and mood stabilizers in reducing GD-related symptomatology. Lithium was particularly effective in subjects with comorbid bipolar disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was the most commonly used psychological intervention and reduced global severity, gambling frequency, and financial loss. Motivational interviewing (MI) seemed to improve several GD domains, alone or in combination with CBT. Self-help interventions (SHIs) showed some efficacy in promoting treatment-seeking, and in combination with other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: We found moderate evidence of effect for CBT, but weaker evidence for pharmacotherapy and SHIs. Results suggested some efficacy for MI in the short but not in the long term. It is likely that certain interventions might be more effective than others on specific features of GD. Further studies are needed to compare the efficacy and acceptability of individual and combined psychosocial and pharmacological interventions, to deliver patient-tailored treatments.",20191026,14,4,10.1097/ADM.0000000000000574,1935-3227

Empirical research has linked inflammatory markers to depressive symptoms and acute psychosocial stress; however, a gap remains as to whether immune response to stress may serve as a putative mechanism of treatment. This preliminary pilot study determined the modest feasibility of assessing psychobiological response to stress as a predictor of CBT outcomes for youth with mood disorders. We evaluated whether participation in a 10-session group-CBT intervention for mood disorders altered inflammatory response to a laboratory psychosocial stress induction and if this alteration in immune stress responsivity was related to a decrease in depressive symptoms. Thirty-four youth (age M = 15.03, SD = 1.91) diagnosed with BD or MDD participated in a 10-session CBT group and pre- and post-group assessments; twenty-eight participants who completed the group had usable cytokine data. Pre- and post-group assessments included stress induction with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) during which inflammatory cytokines were measured at baseline (time 0) and after the TSST at 30, 60, and 90â¯min. Results suggest it is modestly feasible to measure immune response to stress alongside CBT treatment for adolescent mood disorders. Our findings were mixed; across seven cytokines, hierarchical linear models indicated two cytokines, IL6 and IL12, were sensitive to acute laboratory stress. We also found significant correlations between life stress, inflammation, and depression both pre- and post- CBT group. Inflammation pre-group, as measured by IL12 and IL1 ß predicted depressive symptoms following treatment. Although we did not find significant within-subject reductions in inflammation, chronic stress predicted changes in IL ß, signaling the central role of chronic stress. This study offers preliminary evidence that immune responsivity to stress induction could serve as a mechanism of treatment for mood disorders in youth, indicating a potential marker for more personalized model of healthcare.",20191022,120,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.10.012,1879-1379

METHODS: Seventy-six euthymic adult patients with BD were randomly assigned to either Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Supportive Therapy (ST) and followed up for 2 years after completing therapy (Meyer and Hautzinger, 2012). The primary outcome measure was recurrence of mood episodes. The final multivariate Cox regression models included potential covariates, therapy conditions, BAS reward sensitivity, and the interaction between BAS and therapy conditions. RESULTS: BAS emerged as the only significant predictor of time till recurrence of mania, but not depression, but the overall model did not reach significance. There was no interaction between treatment and BAS reward sensitivity. Interestingly, a diagnosis of BD II predicted time till recurrence of depression.

These deficits are considered one of the main drivers of functional disability in BD. This study investigated whether computerized working memory training using the COGMED® program in patients with BD can improve global functioning, therapeutic compliance, and subjective quality of life. METHODS: For this naturalistic prospective study, 40 patients with BD and cognitive complaints were recruited. Sociodemographic, clinical, neurocognitive and functional data were collected before starting the remediation intervention (baseline). At home, patients used the web-based working memory training program COGMED® that included a battery of interactive games (daily sessions, five days per week for five weeks), supported by weekly phone-based feedback. The clinical, neurocognitive and functional assessment was repeated four weeks after the intervention end and compared with the baseline data. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients completed the study. Compared with baseline, general functioning was improved after the working memory training program, as indicated by a mean reduction of 6.78 (SD 4.65) points in the Functioning Assessment Short Test (p<0.001). This result remained significant after controlling for depressive symptomatology improvement. Similarly, the scores of neuropsychological tests for cognitive complaints, as well as verbal and visuospatial working memory components were significantly different before and after the intervention (p<0.05).

The paper combines the expertise of senior clinicians working in the United Kingdom. The article starts by providing general advice on conducting behavioural experiments in people with bipolar disorder. It then offers specific examples of behavioural experiments targeting cognitions around the uncontrollability and danger of affective states, and related behavioural strategies, which have been implicated in the maintenance of bipolar mood swings. The article finishes by providing examples of behavioural experiments for non-mood related difficulties that commonly occur with bipolar experiences including perfectionistic thinking, need for approval, and intrusive memories. Behavioural experiments offer a useful therapeutic technique for instigating cognitive and behavioural change in bipolar disorder.

Patients also received clinical assessments including mood ratings at all time points. RESULTS: Patients showed deficits in all domains at baseline, but similar longitudinal trajectories across time relative to healthy participants in most cognitive domains. For processing speed, patients showed more gains than controls from baseline to 1 year, but these gains stabilized thereafter. Patients with alcohol/substance abuse showed an initial delay but subsequent recovery in executive functioning.

We aimed to establish the efficacy and safety of short pulse width (SPW) and long pulse width (LPW) subcallosal cingulate DBS in depression. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised, crossover trial in an academic hospital in Calgary, AB, Canada. Patients had DSM IV-defined major depressive disorder and bipolar depression (20-70 years old, both sexes) and did not respond to treatment for more than 1 year, with a score of 20 or more on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at recruitment. Patients underwent bilateral DBS implantation into the subcallosal cingulate white matter using diffusion tensor imaging tractography. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 without stratification using a computerised list generator to receive either SPW (90 µs) or LPW (210-450 µs) stimulation for 6 months. Patients and the clinician assessing outcomes were masked to the stimulation group. Keeping frequency constant (130 Hz), either pulse width or voltage was increased monthly, based on response using the HDRS. Patients who did not respond to treatment (<50% reduction in HDRS from baseline) at 6 months crossed over to the opposite stimulation for another 6 months. All patients received individualised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in HDRS at 6 months and 12 months using intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01983904. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2013, and Sept 30, 2016, of 225 patients screened for eligibility, 23 patients were selected for DBS surgery. After one patient withdrew, 22 (mean age 46·4 years, SEM 3·1; 10 [45%] female, 12 [55%] male) were randomly assigned, ten (45%) to LPW stimulation and 12 (55%) to SPW stimulation. Patients were followed up at 6 months and 12 months. There was a significant reduction in HDRS scores (p<0·0001) with no difference between SPW and LPW groups (p=0·54) in the randomisation phase at 6 months. Crossover groups did not show a significant decrease in HDRS within groups (p=0·15) and between groups (p=0·21) from 6-12 months. Adverse events were equal between groups. Worsening anxiety and depression were the most common psychological adverse events. One patient in the SPW group died by suicide. INTERPRETATION: Both LPW and SPW stimulation of subcallosal cingulate white matter tracts carried similar risks and were equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms, suggesting a role for both pulse width and amplitude titration in optimising clinical outcomes in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

The aim of the review was to systematically examine the efficacy of methods used to aid smoking cessation in people with serious mental illness. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to compare the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and behavioural programmes for smoking cessation in people with serious mental illness. Electronic databases were searched for trials to July 2018. We used the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias. RESULTS: Twenty-eight randomised controlled trials were identified. Varenicline increased the likelihood of smoking cessation at both 3 months (risk ratio (RR) 3.56, 95% CI 1.82 to 6.96, p=0.0002) and at 6 months (RR 3.69, 95% CI 1.08 to 12.60, p=0.04). Bupropion was effective at 3 months (RR 3.96, 95% CI 1.86 to 8.40, p=0.0003), especially at a dose of 300 mg/day, but there was no evidence of effect at 6 months (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.47, p=0.28). In one small study, nicotine therapy proved effective at increasing smoking cessation up to a period of 3 months. Bupropion used in conjunction with nicotine replacement therapy showed more effect than single use. Behavioural and bespoke interventions showed little overall benefit. Side effects were found to be low. CONCLUSION: The new information of this review was the effectiveness of varenicline for smoking cessation at both 3 and 6 months and the lack of evidence to support the use of both bupropion and nicotine products for sustained abstinence longer than 3 months.

METHODS: PRISMA-based systematic review of the literature. RESULTS: The acute antidepressant (AD) efficacy of LT was supported by several open-label studies, three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and one pseudorandomized controlled trial. SD showed rapid, acute AD response rates of 43.9%, 59.3%, and 59.4% in eight case series, 11 uncontrolled, studies, and one RCT, respectively. Adjunctive DT obtained significant, rapid anti-manic results in one RCT and one controlled study.

Patients with severe mental illness have a 10-20-year shorter life expectancy when compared with the general population, primarily due to physical chronic disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide a concise update regarding the evidence-based clinical lifestyle interventions in the management of both mental illnesses and the physical chronic diseases highly prevalent in people with mental illness. DISCUSSION: Growing evidence shows that lifestyle interventions are an effective component of management for patients with mental illness to improve mental health, physical health and quality of life, which consequently assists in reducing the life expectancy gap between patients with severe mental illness and the general population. Measures can be taken to improve long-term adherence. The GP plays a crucial part in initiating and supporting patients with these measures.",20191001,48,10,10.31128/AJGP-06-19-4964,2208-7958

We examined whether subjective chronotype, or the time of day an individual prefers to be most active and alert, predicted treatment outcomes differentially in depressed patients attending the morning vs. afternoon IDT streams. The Horne-Östberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) was administered before IDT treatment to 203 consecutive patients experiencing a major depressive episode. Multiple regression was used to predict change in depression and quality of life scores based on treatment stream (morning or afternoon), baseline MEQ scores and the treatment stream by MEQ interaction. The treatment stream by MEQ interaction was a highly significant predictor of both depression and quality of life change scores. Post-hoc analyses based on established MEQ categories revealed that definite evening chronotypes had significantly better responses in the morning stream than did morning chronotypes, and significantly worse responses in the afternoon stream relative to moderate evening or neutral chronotypes. There were insufficient morning chronotypes in the afternoon stream to assess clinical responses for this subgroup. In the morning stream only, there was a significant positive correlation between the change in MEQ scores after four weeks of IDT treatment (i.e. a shift to greater morningness) and the decrease in depression scores (r = .36, p = .003), consistent with a therapeutic phase advance in circadian rhythms. In sum, these preliminary data suggest that definite evening chronotypes may have the greatest relative benefit from attending the morning vs. afternoon IDT stream. As patients currently select which IDT stream they will attend, future work based on randomized treatment assignment and using passive actigraphy to assess circadian phase is currently planned to extend these preliminary findings.",20190910,36,11,10.1080/07420528.2019.1661851,1525-6073

METHODS: Electronic searches (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase) identified economic evaluations relating incremental cost to outcomes in the form of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio published in English since 2000. Searches were concluded in November 2018. Inclusion criteria were: adults with schizophrenia/BD; any psychological/psychosocial intervention (e.g., psychological therapy and integrated/collaborative care); probability of cost-effectiveness at explicitly defined thresholds reported. Comparators could be routine practice, no intervention, or alternative psychological therapies. Screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal were performed using pre-specified criteria and forms. Results were summarized qualitatively. The protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42017056579). RESULTS: Of 3,864 studies identified, 12 met the criteria for data extraction. All were integrated clinical and economic randomized controlled trials. The most common intervention was cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, 6/12 studies). The most common measure of health benefit was the quality-adjusted life-year (6/12). Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 5 years. Interventions were found to be cost-effective in most studies (9/12): the probability of cost-effectiveness ranged from 35-99.5 percent. All studies had limitations and demonstrated uncertainty (particularly related to incremental costs). CONCLUSIONS: Most studies concluded psychological interventions for schizophrenia/BD are cost-effective, including CBT, although there was notable uncertainty. Heterogeneity across studies makes it difficult to reach strong conclusions.

No trials have evaluated individual integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy (MI-CBT) for problematic alcohol use in BD. We therefore assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a novel MI-CBT intervention for alcohol use in BD. METHODS: A single blind RCT was conducted to compare MI-CBT plus treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU only. MI-CBT was delivered over 20 sessions with participants followed up at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-randomisation. Primary outcomes were the feasibility and acceptability of MI-CBT (recruitment to target, retention to follow-up and therapy, acceptability of therapy and absence of adverse events). We also conducted preliminary analyses of alcohol and mood outcomes (frequency and severity of alcohol use and time to mood relapse). RESULTS: 44 participants were recruited with 75% retention to 6 and 12 months follow-up. Therapy participants attended a mean of 17.6 (SD 4.5) sessions.

Limited data are available on how to optimize treatment for BD, especially for those who suffer from persistent and residual depressive symptoms. Preliminary evidence suggests Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as a psychological treatment option for BD. This study aims to investigate whether adding MBCT to treatment as usual (TAU) will result in symptomatic and functional improvements in adults with BD compared to TAU alone. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a prospective, evaluator blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of MBCT + TAU and TAU alone in 160 adults with bipolar type I and type II. Assessments will be conducted at baseline (T0), mid-treatment (Tmid), and at 3 (T1), 6 (T2), 9 (T3), 12 (T4), and 15 (T5) months follow-up. Primary outcome is post-treatment severity of depressive symptoms (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Clinician administered). Secondary outcomes are severity of (hypo) manic symptoms, anxiety, relapse rates, overall functioning, positive mental health, and cost-effectiveness. As possible mediators will be assessed rumination of negative affect, dampening and rumination of positive affect, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion.

Thereafter, based on the mechanism of action of lithium, intracellular signal transduction systems, including inositol metabolism and intracellular calcium signaling, have drawn attention. Involvement of intracellular calcium signaling has been supported by genetics and cellular studies. Elucidation of the neural circuits affected by calcium signaling abnormalities is critical, and our previous study suggested a role of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus. The genetic vulnerability of mitochondria causes calcium dysregulation and results in the hyperexcitability of serotonergic neurons, which are suggested to be susceptible to oxidative stress. Efficacy of anticonvulsants, animal studies of candidate genes, and studies using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons have suggested a relation between bipolar disorder and the hyperexcitability of neurons. Recent genetic findings suggest the roles of polyunsaturated acids.

Epidemiological and imaging studies in bipolar disorder, in addition to a few trials in Alzheimer's disease support the clinical translation of these findings. Nonetheless, there is limited controlled data about potential use of lithium to treat or prevent dementia. AIMS: To determine the benefits of lithium treatment in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a clinical condition associated with high risk for Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: A total of 61 community-dwelling, physically healthy, older adults with MCI were randomised to receive lithium or placebo (1:1) for 2 years (double-blind phase), and followed-up for an additional 24 months (single-blinded phase) (trial registration at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01055392). Lithium carbonate was prescribed to yield subtherapeutic concentrations (0.25-0.5 mEq/L). Primary outcome variables were the cognitive (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale) and functional (Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes) parameters obtained at baseline and after 12 and 24 months. Secondary outcomes were neuropsychological test scores; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers determined at 0, 12 and 36 months; conversion rate from MCI to dementia (0-48 months). RESULTS: Participants in the placebo group displayed cognitive and functional decline, whereas lithium-treated patients remained stable over 2 years. Lithium treatment was associated with better performance on memory and attention tests after 24 months, and with a significant increase in CSF amyloid-beta peptide (Aß1-42) after 36 months. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term lithium attenuates cognitive and functional decline in amnestic MCI, and modifies Alzheimer's disease-related CSF biomarkers. The present data reinforces the disease-modifying properties of lithium in the MCI-Alzheimer's disease continuum. DECLARATION OF INTEREST: None.",20190406,215,5,10.1192/bjp.2019.76,1472-1465

Previous studies have reported significant impairments in functional and quality of life outcomes and a possible relationship between these variables and cognitive performance. Cognitive rehabilitation interventions have been proposed to address these outcomes but positive results are still scarce. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new intervention developed to address both cognitive and functional impairment. METHODS: Thirty-nine individuals were included in this randomized controlled trial. All participants were evaluated by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and completed functional and quality of life (QOL) scales. Patients were randomized to either treatment as usual (TAU) or Cognitive Behavior Rehabilitation (CBR), an add-on treatment delivered in 12 weekly group sessions. All individuals were revaluated after 12 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 39 bipolar type I or II patients were included in the analysis, 19 in the TAU group and 20 in the CBR condition. At the entrance of the study, both groups were statistically similar regarding clinical, socio-demographics and cognitive variables. After the end of the intervention, CBR individuals had significantly improved reaction time, visual memory and emotion recognition. In contrast, individuals in the CBR did not present a statistically change in functional and QOL scores after the 12-week intervention. CONCLUSIONS: CBR intervention showed promising results in improving some of the commonly impaired cognitive domains in BD.

We aimed to explore the association between SCIT and improvements in the clinical symptoms and functioning of partially remitted patients with BD in China. Seventy-four BD patients were randomly assigned to the SCIT and psychoeducation (Control) groups. All subjects participated in group interventions weekly for 8 weeks.

As the field turns its attention to intervention scale-up, it is important to understand whether the effectiveness of behavioural weight loss interventions for people with SMI, like ACHIEVE, differ for specific subgroups. METHODS: This study examined whether the effectiveness of the ACHIEVE intervention differed by participant characteristics (e.g. age, sex, race, psychiatric diagnosis, body mass index) and/or their weight-related attitudes and behaviours (e.g. eating, food preparation, and shopping habits). We used likelihood-based mixed effects models to examine whether the baseline to 18 month effects of the ACHIEVE intervention differed across subgroups.

Compromised long-term functioning can ensue. There is evidence that psychological therapies alongside pharmacology may be more efficacious earlier in the course of the disorder. Intervention in the early stages may thus reduce the burden and risk associated with BD and mitigate the impact of the disorder on normal developmental trajectories. To date, however, the availability of evidence-based psychological therapies for young people with early BD is limited. Furthermore, there are no large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of such interventions. METHODS: The study is a prospective, single-blind, RCT examining the effectiveness of an adjunctive individualized and manualized psychological intervention, compared with treatment as usual within youth-specific early intervention services. The REsearch into COgnitive and behavioural VERsatility (RECOVER) intervention is delivered over a 6-month period. About 122 young people in the early stages of BD-I (at least one manic episode in the previous 2 years, with no more than five lifetime treated/untreated manic or hypomanic episodes) will be recruited. The assessments will occur at baseline, 3, 6 (primary endpoint, end of treatment), 9, 12, 15 and 18 months. RESULTS: Recruitment will commence in January 2019 and is anticipated to occur over a 3.5-year period. CONCLUSIONS: To date, there are no evidence-based psychological therapies tailored to young people with early BD. We will test whether early psychological intervention in the course of BD can reduce the symptomatic, psychological, vocational and social impacts that are seen in entrenched disorder.",20190212,13,6,10.1111/eip.12797,1751-7893

However, many individuals do not complete a full course of EBP. The current study aimed to quantify the percentage of veterans receiving adequate EBP in VA hospitals and identify factors related to treatment completion. METHODS: A national sample of 16,559 VA patients who began cognitive processing therapy (CPT) or prolonged exposure (PE) during fiscal year 2015 was obtained via administrative data. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate individual-level predictors of treatment adequacy, defined as eight sessions within 14 weeks. Generalized linear models were used to examine facility-level factors. RESULTS: A total of 5,142 (31.1%) veterans completed eight or more sessions of psychotherapy. Older age was associated with greater odds of completing eight or more sessions (odds ratio OR=1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.01, 1.02, p<0.001), and comorbid bipolar or psychotic disorders were associated with reduced odds of completion (OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.80, 0.99, p=0.03). The percentage of patients who completed eight or more sessions was higher at facilities with higher percentages of EBP use among all patients with PTSD (ß=6.55, SE=1.97, p=0.001) and greater numbers of EBP-certified providers (ß=0.004, SE=0.002, p=0.038) and lower at facilities with a higher percentage of patients receiving a PTSD Checklist (ß=-1.16, SE=0.46, p=0.011).

The aim of this study was to determine the diet quality of BD patients and to investigate its putative associations with comorbid obesity and disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, as well as the relationship between diet and clinical features of BD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eating patterns in 113 euthymic BD patients and 160 healthy control subjects were assessed using data obtained from a food frequency questionnaire. Associations of diet quality with subjects' weight, waist circumference (WC), insulin resistance index and clinical features of BD were also analyzed. RESULTS: BD patients had lower Mediterranean Diet Score than controls. Using principal analysis, four dietary patterns were revealed in the BD group (western-type, pro-healthy carbohydrates, unhealthy snacks, and meats and potatoes). Over 70% of patients with BD had Body Mass Index above 25kg/m2. The values of Fasting Triglycerides Glucose Index and WC were significantly higher in BD patients than in the control group. No significant association between diet quality indices and the clinical course of BD was found. CONCLUSIONS: In our work, euthymic bipolar patients showed unhealthy dietary patterns and had lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet than the controls.

METHODS: 145 adolescents with bipolar I or II disorder were randomly assigned to family-focused therapy (FFT-A) or a brief psychoeducational therapy (enhanced care; EC) and followed over 2 years. Participants received pharmacotherapy for the study's duration. We examined whether comorbid anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs; i.e., oppositional defiant and conduct disorder) predicted the proportion of weeks that participants experienced mood symptoms during follow-up, and whether comorbid disorders moderated the effects of treatment assignment on mood symptoms and family conflict. RESULTS: Comorbid anxiety was associated with a greater proportion of weeks with depressive symptoms, more severe (hypo)manic symptoms during follow-up, and greater family conflict over the 2-year study. Comorbid ADHD was associated with a greater proportion of weeks with (hypo)manic symptoms, more severe (hypo)manic symptoms, and greater family conflict. Additionally, youth with comorbid ADHD who received FFT-A had more favorable trajectories of (hypo)manic symptoms and family functioning than youth with comorbid ADHD who received EC. Comorbid DBDs were consistently associated with more severe depressive symptoms and greater family conflict throughout the study. LIMITATIONS: Randomization to treatments was not stratified on comorbid disorders. The longitudinal trajectories of anxiety, attentional, and disruptive behavior symptoms were not examined.

Pre-treatment suicide ideation measured with the BDI suicide item was considered as a predictor of treatment outcomes - controlling for age, gender, number of attended therapy sessions, as well as pre-treatment depression severity. Results: Hierarchical regression revealed that age, gender, number of completed therapy sessions and depression severity at baseline could explain 25% of the variance in post-treatment BDI-scores. Adding suicide ideation significantly improved the amount of variance explained to 27%. Treatment outcomes were worse for patients with more severe depression, suicidal patients, patients receiving more therapy-sessions and older patients.

Few studies (k = 8) used non-psychotic clinical comparator groups, although very low-quality evidence (k = 3) found people with bipolar disorder may perform better. Negative symptoms (k = 13, N = 648, r = -0.17, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.07) and lower IQ (k = 11, N = 525, r = 0.20, 95% CI 0.29-0.10), but not positive symptoms (k = 10, N = 512, r = -0.01, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.08), each had small-moderate associations with poorer decision-making. Lower quality evidence suggested general symptoms, working memory, social functioning, awareness of emotional responses to information, and attentional bias towards gain are associated with decision-making, but not education, executive functioning or overall symptoms.

METHOD: The Multidimensional Self-esteem Scale (MSWS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered to 147 psychiatric in-patients with current depressive symptoms due to an affective disorder (major depression, bipolar I, dysthymia). Self-esteem was measured pre-treatment (t0) and post-treatment (t4, after 5 weeks of eight group sessions); the BDI was applied weekly. A linear mixed growth analysis was conducted to estimate the change in depressive symptoms including interactions with self-esteem. RESULTS: Within the 5 weeks of group therapy, depressive symptoms showed a linear decline, which was stronger for patients with higher gains in self-esteem between t0 and t4. Self-esteem at t0 was unrelated to the change in depression but predicted self-esteem at t4.

Collegial consultation could allow a framed prescription of treatments that are not authorized in specific indications. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity in adult populations (ADHD) is a striking example of a pathology where off-label prescription is frequent. First considered to be a childhood disorder, the awareness of this condition in adults is increasing, leading to the development of new clinical practices and treatments. However, the adult ADHD diagnosis and its management are still emerging in France despite a high prevalence. Treatment of adult ADHD relies on methylphenidate prescription, but the initiation of this drug is not authorized in adult populations. Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant that is structurally close to amphetamine and acts as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Due to these pharmacological properties, neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular side-effects could occur. Furthermore, its addictive potential has led France to classify it as a psychoactive drug, dispensed via secured prescription. The first prescription and the one-year follow-up are restricted to neurologists, paediatrics, psychiatrists and sleep disorders specialists at hospital. The objective of this article is to propose a multidisciplinary framework for the off-label prescription of methylphenidate in adult ADHD. METHODS: The Multidisciplinary Advice Consultation for Exceptional Addiction Treatments (Consultation d'Avis Multidisciplinaire de Traitements d'Exception en Addictologie CAMTEA) was first set up in Lille for the prescription of baclofen in alcohol dependence and was then extended to topiramate in binge eating disorder. This procedure has been adapted to the particularities of ADHD in adult populations, the differential diagnosis (bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, anxious disorder, personality disorder, substance use disorder) and the co-morbidities requiring a full psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. Moreover, a particular attention has been paid to the monitoring of neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular and misuse risk because of the potential side-effects of methylphenidate. RESULTS: The proposed prescription framework is structured into several specialized consultations. A first psychiatric evaluation aims to diagnose adult ADHD, using the French version of the Diagnostisch Interview Voor ADHD 2.0 questionnaire (DIVA 2.0), and to assess the quality of life impact with the Weiss Functional Inventory Rating Scale (WIFRS). It also searches for the presence of differential diagnosis or co-morbidities. The second appointment consists of a pharmacological evaluation that aims to search for contraindications and potential drug interaction. A neuropsychological evaluation based on standardized tests (Weschler Adulte Intelligence Scale [WAIS IV], Conner's Continuous Performance Test 3 [CPT] and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personnality Inventory [MMPI]) is also required to evaluate neurocognitive disabilities and personality features. Once the parameters of the different assessments have been collected, the synthesis is presented during a multidisciplinary meeting in order to assess the risk-benefit ratio for each patient. Several specialties are involved in this multidisciplinary meeting: psychiatry, addictology, general medicine, addictovigilance, pharmacovigilance and neuropsychology. One strategy among three possibilities can be decided: (1) contraindication to treatment with methylphenidate, (2) attention deficit disorder that does not require medication management, and (3) indication of treatment with methylphenidate with the choice of the pharmacological form (immediate or prolonged release). A biological check-up and an electrocardiogram are carried out systematically before any treatment. If the decision is made to initiate treatment, it is started at the lowest dosage and followed by a titration phase. A weekly follow-up is carried out during the titration phase in order to assess treatment efficacy and safety. After treatment stabilization, the general practitioner can carry out the renewal, and the patient will be reassessed within the framework of the multidisciplinary consultation every 3 months. CONCLUSION: When an off-label prescription is being considered, it must comply with the basic rules of good clinical practice, and the benefit/risk ratio should be constantly reassessed. The proposed multidisciplinary framework, adapted to the characteristics of adult ADHD and the pharmacological properties of methylphenidate, appears to be an interesting strategy to meet the requirements of the good clinical practice. The complementary assessments carried out and the collegial framework allow enhancing the patient's follow-up and minimize the drug risk, particularly in the psychiatric, addictive and cardiovascular adverse events. Finally, this framework could also help the monitoring of other off-label treatments for ADHD, such as atomoxetine or guanfacine.",20180821,45,1,10.1016/j.encep.2018.05.008,0013-7006

However, there is little evidence regarding the use of ultrabrief right unilateral (RUL-UB) ECT in treatment of acute manic episodes. The aim of this study was to report on the effectiveness and cognitive profile of ECT in bipolar mania, including a sample who received RUL-UB ECT. METHODS: This naturalistic study retrospectively collected data in 33 patients who received ECT with concurrent antipsychotics for mania between October 1, 2014, and July 30, 2016. Electroconvulsive therapy was given using RUL-UB, brief-pulse right unilateral, or brief-pulse bitemporal approaches, dosed according to the patient's seizure threshold. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were administered to patients before and after the ECT course. RESULTS: For the whole sample, there was a significant improvement in BPRS (total score and manic subscale), YMRS, and MoCA total scores across the ECT treatment course. The overall BPRS response rate was 84%, and mean scores decreased from 42.1 (SD, 12.0) to 26.0 (SD, 4.0). The 13 patients who received RUL-UB ECT also showed significant improvement in BPRS, YMRS, and MoCA scores over the treatment course. CONCLUSIONS: Electroconvulsive therapy in general and also specifically RUL-UB ECT were effective in treating mania and also led to global cognitive improvement.",20180629,35,1,10.1097/YCT.0000000000000519,1533-4112

Cognitive behavior therapy is an effective treatment for major depression. By quantifying genetic risk scores based on common genetic variants, the aim of this report was to explore the utility of psychiatric and cognitive trait genetic risk scores, for predicting the response of 894 adults with major depressive disorder to cognitive behavior therapy. The participants were recruited in a psychiatric setting, and the primary outcome score was measured using the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Rated. Single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping arrays were used to calculate the genomic risk scores based on large genetic studies of six phenotypes: major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intelligence, and educational attainment. Linear mixed-effect models were used to test the relationships between the six genetic risk scores and cognitive behavior therapy outcome. Our analyses yielded one significant interaction effect (B = 0.09, p < 0.001): the autism spectrum disorder genetic risk score correlated with Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Rated changes during treatment, and the higher the autism spectrum disorder genetic load, the less the depressive symptoms decreased over time. The genetic risk scores for the other psychiatric and cognitive traits were not related to depressive symptom severity or change over time. Our preliminary results indicated, as expected, that the genomics of the response of patients with major depression to cognitive behavior therapy were complex and that future efforts should aim to maximize sample size and limit subject heterogeneity in order to gain a better understanding of the use of genetic risk factors to predict treatment outcome.",20181110,24,4,10.1038/s41380-018-0289-9,1476-5578

One way to establish external validity is to examine measures representing separate facets of the pathology with a battery of tests in the same cohort of animals. Additionally, utilizing the same animals in a battery of tests can help to reduce the number of animals in research. However, issues had been raised regarding the analysis of data coming from batteries and the standard practice is to analyze each test separately. This approach introduces two problems: (1) the analysis answers the question regarding separate tests but not regarding the general effect; (2) there is no correction for multiple comparisons. One way to overcome these challenges is to use transformations to Z-scores. We suggest an additional approach, analyzing test batteries with multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). METHODS: To compare the outcomes of Z-score analysis and MANOVA we re-analyzed two published studies where data were initially analyzed separately for each test. Additionally, we computed effect sizes. RESULTS: The first study tested interaction between sex and lithium in a battery of manic-like behaviors, the second study tested asenapine in a battery of anxiety-like behaviors. For the first study, the MANOVA analysis indicated no effects of sex and a significant antimanic-like effect of lithium and for the second study, the MANOVA indicated a significant anxiolytic effect of asenapine. Z-score analysis resulted in a significant general antimanic-like effect in the lithium study but failed to demonstrate the anxiolytic effects of asenapine in the second study. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to suggest that MANOVA is an appropriate way to analyze data from test batteries and that its use, when appropriate, can increase the validity, predictability and reproducibility of results.",20171202,178,,10.1016/j.pbb.2017.11.003,1873-5177

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of a therapeutic education program on the quality of life of patients with bipolar disorder (type 1 or 2). METHOD: This study included 18 patients with bipolar disorder (type 1 or 2) following the therapeutic education program on bipolar disorder which includes 8 sessions of 2hours each. The assessment of quality of life and mood, self-esteem, insight and global functioning was performed before and after the program using the following tools: World Health Organization Quality Of Life questionnaire in short version (WHOQOL-Bref), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Birchwood Insight Scale and Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. The total score of WHOQOL-Bref constitutes the primary study outcome. The under-scores of WHOQOL-Bref as insight, self-esteem, functioning, depression and mania scores constitute secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Our results show an improvement in quality of life, regarding global and main dimension scores of WHOQOL-Bref. The mean total scores for quality of life at the beginning and the end of the program were respectively 55.47/100 (standard deviation=14.11) and 60.03/100 (standard deviation=12.62). However, the difference was still not significant even after statistical adjustment with depression, mania and functioning scores. Self-esteem was significantly improved (P=0.0469). Quality of life and self-esteem evolutions were strongly related (correlation coefficient=0.80, P=0.0006). At the end of the program, the less depressed the patients were, the better their quality of life was (correlation coefficient=0.67, P=0.0090). We did not find any correlation between quality of life and mania intensity or global functioning level at the end of the program. CONCLUSION: This study suggests a need to focus on self-esteem perception in order to understand and ameliorate the quality of life of patients with bipolar disorders. Going further, the use of bipolar disorder specific scales to assess quality of life would be more relevant.",20180710,45,2,10.1016/j.encep.2018.04.001,0013-7006

Though sleep inertia is common in insomnia and may interfere with treatment, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) does not routinely include a component to address sleep inertia. The present study evaluates such a component, the RISE-UP routine, in CBTI for insomnia comorbid with bipolar disorder. We hypothesized that the RISE-UP routine would increase physical activity in the morning and reduce the duration and severity of self-reported sleep inertia. Sleep and sleep inertia were monitored in the week prior to and following the intervention with daily sleep diaries, actigraphy, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants were randomized to a bipolar-specific modification of CBT-I (CBTI-BP) with RISE-UP (Nâ¯=â¯20) or a psychoeducation (PE) comparison condition (Nâ¯=â¯20). The treatment experiment (RISE-UP vs PE) was completed in the first treatment session. RISE-UP reduced the duration and severity of self-reported sleep inertia, as measured by diary reports and by EMA ratings, and was rated as acceptable and credible.

The aim of management during this time is to maintain wellness and prevent future episodes of illness. Medication is often the mainstay of treatment during this phase, but adherence to treatment is a significant problem. In recent years, long-acting injectable (LAI) solutions have been proposed, but these too have limitations. This paper discusses the options that are currently available and critically appraises the effectiveness of this strategy. METHOD: The authors reviewed the small number of open-label and randomised studies on LAI medications in bipolar disorder and evaluated the efficacy and safety of these medications. RESULTS: The studies reviewed show benefit of LAIs for the management of bipolar disorder but have several key limitations to the generalisability of findings to routine practice. CONCLUSIONS: LAIs have an emerging role in the management of bipolar disorder and, although it is not without limitations, this strategy addresses some issues of long-term treatment and medication. Patients with bipolar disorder that are non-adherent or have an unstable illness with a predilection towards mania are possibly better suited to the use of LAIs, though more research is required to fully assess the effectiveness of this approach.",20181018,20 Suppl 2,,10.1111/bdi.12698,1399-5618

The purpose of this review is to provide a clinically relevant update of recent selected key publications regarding the use of atypical antipsychotics in this population. METHODS: Studies reviewed included randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled medication trials conducted within the past 5 years. A PubMed search was conducted for each of the 11 second-generation antipsychotic medications currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States: clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, paliperidone, asenapine, iloperidone, lurasidone, and cariprazine. Trials published in English with subjects 18 years of age and younger were included in this review. Additional studies, chosen for their significance to clinical practice, were also included at the discretion of the authors. RESULTS: This review demonstrates that more empiric data are available regarding both the acute efficacy and, to a lesser extent, the longer-term efficacy and tolerability for several of the considered antipsychotic medications. The clinical conditions for which these medications have been studied include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Tourette's disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. They have also been used as an adjunctive treatment for disruptive behavior disorders with aggression, which have not responded to treatment with stimulants. CONCLUSION: Evidence regarding the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic medications for mental health disorders in children and adolescents has expanded exponentially in recent years. However, more information is needed so that evidence-based comparisons between medications can be made. In the future, data enabling the selection of medications based upon individual patient characteristics could potentially lead to greater efficacy and efficiency in treating what are frequently debilitating medical conditions. Maladaptive aggression in children, often treated with antipsychotics, is one such area in which there is a dearth of actual information available to the clinician. It is to be hoped that additional, longer-term studies of these medications will further inform evidence-based practice in clinical settings.",20181013,28,9,10.1089/cap.2018.0037,1557-8992

These analyses compared smokers with BD versus smokers with other affective disorders (ADs; anxiety and unipolar depression) and smokers with no mental health conditions (MHCs). METHOD: Participants (n = 2570) were a subsample of those enrolled in a smoking cessation trial comparing two web-delivered intervention approaches: acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitive behavioral therapy. Those included in this analysis self-reported having BD (n = 221), other ADs (n = 783) or no major MHCs (n = 1566). Surveys assessed baseline characteristics and self-reported abstinence at 3, 6, and 12-months post-randomization. Treatment utilization was tracked via page views. RESULTS: Smokers with BD were distinct from both AD and no MHC smokers on the majority of baseline characteristics. At 12-months, quit rates were lower for smokers with BD (20%) than no MHCs (29%; p = 0.01), but no different than other ADs (20%; p =  .467).

PTN cause significant distress, are associated with large costs, and are an independent risk factor for suicide. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options for PTN exist. A previous review in this journal demonstrated that Prazosin, an alpha blocker, was a preferred pharmacological treatment for PTN and imagery rescripting therapy (IRT) was a preferred non-pharmacological treatment. Since that time, new and important research findings create the need for an updated review. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on the results of a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine, Prazosin has been downgraded by both the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and the Veterans Health Administration/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) for PTN. In Canada, Nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, appears to be promising. Few recent studies have been published on non-pharmacological interventions for PTN; however, recent data is available with regard to using IRT on an inpatient setting, with German combat veterans, and through the use of virtual technology. Recent evidence supports the use of exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy (ERRT) with children and individuals with comorbid bipolar disorder and PTN. Prazosin is no longer considered a first-line pharmacological intervention for PTN by AASM and VA/DoD. However, in the absence of a suitable alternative, it will likely remain the preferred option of prescribers. IRT and ERRT remain preferred non-pharmacological treatments of PTN. Combining cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) with IRT or ERRT may lead to improved outcomes.",20181012,20,12,10.1007/s11920-018-0971-2,1535-1645

However, whether repeated ketamine infusions would cause short-and long-term neurocognitive impairments was not clear. Our aims were to investigate the neurocognitive effects of six ketamine infusions and to examine the association between these infusions and the antidepressant response in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. METHODS: Six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over a 12-day period were administered to 84 patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Severity of depressive symptoms and four domains of neurocognition, including speed of processing, working memory, visual learning and verbal learning, were assessed at baseline, one day following the last infusion and again two weeks post-infusion. RESULTS: Significant improvements were found on speed of processing ( F=9.344, p<0.001) and verbal learning ( F=5.647, p=0.004) in a linear mixed model. The Sobel test showed significant indirect effects between time and improvement in speed of processing (Sobel test=3.573, p<0.001) as well as improvement in verbal learning (Sobel test=6.649, p<0.001), which were both significantly mediated by change in depressive symptoms. Logistic regression analysis showed ketamine responders had better visual learning at baseline than non-responders (B=0.118, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that neurocognitive function would not deteriorate after six ketamine infusions, while verbal learning and speed of processing improved over 13 days and 26 days of observation, respectively.

However, there is currently no clinically available treatment with direct and lasting effects on cognitive impairment in BD. We will examine the effect of a novel form of cognitive remediation, action-based cognitive remediation (ABCR), on cognitive impairment in patients with BD, and explore the neural substrates of potential treatment efficacy on cognition. METHODS/DESIGN: The trial has a randomized, controlled, parallel-group design. In total, 58 patients with BD in full or partial remission aged 18-55 years with objective cognitive impairment will be recruited. Participants are randomized to 10 weeks of ABCR or a control group. Assessments encompassing neuropsychological testing and mood ratings, and questionnaires on subjective cognitive complaints, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life are carried out at baseline, after 2 weeks of treatment, after the end of treatment, and at a six-month-follow-up after treatment completion. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans are performed at baseline and 2 weeks into treatment. The primary outcome is a cognitive composite score spanning verbal memory, attention, and executive function. Two complete data sets for 52 patients will provide a power of 80% to detect a clinically relevant between-group difference on the primary outcome. Behavioral data will be analyzed using mixed models in SPSS while MRI data will be analyzed with the FMRIB Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT). Early treatment-related changes in neural activity from baseline to week 2 will be investigated for the dorsal prefrontal cortex and hippocampus as the regions of interest and with an exploratory whole-brain analysis. DISCUSSION: The results will provide insight into whether ABCR has beneficial effects on cognition and functioning in remitted patients with BD. The results will also provide insight into early changes in neural activity associated with improvement of cognition, which can aid future treatment development.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an emerging psychotherapy that has shown benefit in related and comorbid conditions such as major depressive, anxiety, and substance disorders. Furthermore, neurocognitive studies of MBCT suggest that it may have effects on some of the theorized pathophysiological processes in BD. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review using PsychINFO and PubMed databases to identify studies reporting clinical and/or neurocognitive findings for MBCT for BD. RESULTS: This search revealed 13 articles. There was a wide range in methodological quality and most studies were underpowered or did not present power calculations. However, MBCT did not appear to precipitate mania, and there is preliminary evidence to support a positive effect on anxiety, residual depression, mood regulation, and broad attentional and frontal-executive control. LIMITATIONS: As meta-analysis is not yet possible due to study heterogeneity and quality, the current review is a narrative synthesis, and therefore net effects cannot be estimated.

Emerging data suggest that dorsal prefrontal cortex target engagement is a key neurocircuitry biomarker of pro-cognitive treatment effects. AIMS: In this randomized controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we test this hypothesis by investigating the effects of an ineffective cognitive remediation intervention on dorsal prefrontal response during strategic memory encoding and working memory engagement. METHODS: Bipolar disorder patients in partial remission with subjective cognitive difficulties were randomized to receive 12-week group-based cognitive remediation ( n = 13) or to continue their standard treatment ( n = 14). The patients performed a strategic episodic picture encoding task and a spatial n-back working memory task under functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and following cognitive remediation or standard treatment. RESULTS: The right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was commonly activated by both strategic memory tasks across all patients. The task-related prefrontal engagement was not altered by cognitive remediation relative to standard treatment. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex response was not significantly associated with recall accuracy or working memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: As hypothesized, no task-related change in prefrontal activity was observed in a negative cognitive remediation trial in remitted bipolar disorder patients. By complementing previous findings linking cognitive improvement with increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex engagement, our negative findings provide additional validity evidence to the dorsal prefrontal target engagement biomarker model of cognitive improvement by strengthening the proposed causality between modulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex engagement and pro-cognitive effects.",20180705,32,10,10.1177/0269881118783334,1461-7285

Investigating clinical subtypes of the disorder may help to clarify diagnostic boundaries and inform targeted treatment. This study used a full diagnostic instrument to examine symptom patterns among youth with BD. METHOD: Trained interviewers completed the Washington University Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (WASH-U-KSADS) with 71 children (7 to 13 y of age) and families as part of the baseline assessment for a randomized clinical trial of Child- and Family-focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CFF-CBT) compared with treatment as usual (TAU) for pediatric BD. All participants met DSM-IV-TR criteria for a bipolar spectrum disorder. Hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses were performed. Resultant clusters were compared on symptom severity and psychosocial functioning at baseline and across treatment. RESULTS: Two distinct symptom profiles emerged: dysregulated/defiant and classic presentation. The dysregulated/defiant cluster was characterized by more externalizing and disruptive behaviors, whereas the classic cluster presented with more severe depression, hallmark manic symptoms, anxiety, and inattention. CFF-CBT consistently promoted psychosocial coping skills, such as problem solving and self-control, for the dysregulated/defiant cluster. TAU also promoted these skills among the individuals in the classic presentation group but not those with symptoms in the dysregulated/defiant cluster.

Physical activity (PA) is effective in preventing and managing these conditions in the general population, however individuals with SMI engage in substantially less PA and more sedentary behaviour (SB) compared to healthy counterparts. Furthermore, the effectiveness of intervening to increase PA or reduce SB in SMI populations is unknown. Therefore, we systematically reviewed studies measuring changes in PA or SB following behavioural interventions in people with SMI. A systematic search of major databases was conducted from inception until 1/3/2018 for behavioural interventions reporting changes in PA or SB in people with SMI. From 3018 initial hits, 32 articles were eligible, including 16 controlled trials (CT's; Treatment nâ¯=â¯1025, Control nâ¯=â¯1162) and 16 uncontrolled trials (nâ¯=â¯655). Of 16 CTs, seven (47%) reported significant improvements in PA, although only one found changes with an objective measure. Of 16 uncontrolled trials, 3 (20%) found improvements in PA (one with objective measurement). No intervention study had a primary aim of changing SB, nor did any note changes in SB using an objective measure. In conclusion, there is inconsistent and low quality evidence to show that interventions can be effective in changing PA or SB in this population.

Challenges include syndromal and subsyndromal mood instability, comorbid anxiety, and uncertainty around mechanisms to target. The Oxford Mood Action Psychology Programme (OxMAPP) offered a novel approach within a cognitive behavioural framework, via mental imagery-focused cognitive therapy (ImCT). AIMS: This clinical audit evaluated referral rates, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction with the OxMAPP service. METHOD: Eleven outpatients with BD received ImCT in addition to standard psychiatric care. Mood data were collected weekly from 6 months pre-treatment to 6 months post-treatment via routine mood monitoring. Anxiety was measured weekly from start of treatment until 1 month post-treatment. Patient feedback was provided via questionnaire. RESULTS: Referral and treatment uptake rates indicated acceptability to referrers and patients. From pre- to post-treatment, there was (i) a significant reduction in the duration of depressive episode relapses, and (ii) a non-significant trend towards a reduction in the number of episodes, with small to medium effect size. There was a large effect size for the reduction in weekly anxiety symptoms from assessment to 1 month follow-up. Patient feedback indicated high levels of satisfaction with ImCT, and underscored the importance of the mental imagery focus. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical audit provides preliminary evidence that ImCT can help improve depressive and anxiety symptoms in BD as part of integrated clinical care, with high patient satisfaction and acceptability.

Studies in patients with mood disorders have found contradicting positive and negative effects of statins on mood and cognition, with limited data in bipolar disorder (BD). The objective of this study was to assess the association between statin use and cognition in older adults with BD. METHODS: In a cross-sectional sample of 143 euthymic older adults with BD (age &#8805; 50), statin users (n = 48) and nonusers (n = 95) were compared for cognitive outcomes: Global and cognitive domain z-scores were calculated from detailed neuropsychological batteries using normative data from healthy comparators (n = 87). RESULTS: The sample had a mean age of 64.3 (±8.9) years, 65.0% were female, with an average of 15.1 (±2.79) years of education.

We recently conducted a pilot trial of transdiagnostic CBT to target anxiety and emotion dysregulation in BD adjunctive to pharmacotherapy. Reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms were significantly predicted by baseline levels of neuroticism and perceived affective control, as well as changes over time in emotion regulation skills. The present study investigates mechanism of treatment response by examining the relationship between baseline emotion regulation-related neural circuitry and trial outcomes. METHODS: Nineteen patients completed baseline resting state fMRI scans prior to treatment randomization. Functional connectivity between the anterior insula (AI) and regions in the salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and executive control network (ECN) were examined as predictors of baseline and treatment-related changes in emotion regulation. RESULTS: Greater improvements in emotion regulation were predicted by weaker right dorsal AI - right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC; SN) and stronger bilateral dorsal AI - bilateral amygdala functional connectivity. Baseline neuroticism was negatively correlated with right dorsal AI- inferior parietal lobule (ECN) functional connectivity, and baseline deficits in perceived affective control were positively associated with ventral AI - bilateral dACC (SN) connectivity. LIMITATIONS: Small sample limits interpretability of treatment-specific effects. CONCLUSION: Baseline functional connectivity of emotion-regulation related neural circuitry significantly predicted change in emotion regulation-related dimensions associated with anxiety and depression symptom reduction.

Chronic vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is recognized for the management of TRD, but few studies have examined its long-term effects on cognitive dysfunction in unipolar and bipolar resistant depression. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the course of cognitive functions and clinical symptoms in a cohort of patients treated with VNS for TRD. METHODS: In 14 TRD patients with VNS, standardized clinical and neuropsychological measures covering memory, attention/executive functions, and psychomotor speed were analyzed prestimulation and up to 2 years poststimulation. RESULTS: Vagus nerve stimulation patients significantly improved on cognitive and clinical measures. Learning and memory improved rapidly after 1 month of stimulation, and other cognitive functions improved gradually over time. Cognitive improvements were sustained up to 2 years of treatment. At 1 month, improvement in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores was not correlated with changes in any of the cognitive scores, whereas at 12 months, the change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score was significantly correlated with several measures (Stroop interference, verbal fluency, and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure delayed recall). CONCLUSIONS: In recent years, a growing interest in cognitive dysfunction in depression has emerged.

The new diagnostic criteria of ASD focuses on two core domains: social communication impairment and restricted interests/repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of ASD has been steadily increasing over the past two decades, with current estimates reaching up to 1 in 36 children. Hereditary factors, parental history of psychiatric disorders, pre-term births, and fetal exposure to psychotropic drugs or insecticides have all been linked to higher risk of ASD. Several scales such as the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), The Autism Spectrum Disorder-Observation for Children (ASD-OC), The Developmental, Dimensional, and Diagnostic Interview (3di), are available to aid in better assessing the behaviors and symptoms associated with ASD. Nearly 75% of ASD patients suffer from comorbid psychiatric illnesses or conditions, which may include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, Tourette syndrome, and others. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available for ASD. Pharmacological treatments include psychostimulants, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists. These medications provide partial symptomatic relief of core symptoms of ASD or manage the symptoms of comorbid conditions. Non-pharmacological interventions, which show promising evidence in improving social interaction and verbal communication of ASD patients, include music therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and social behavioral therapy. Hormonal therapies with oxytocyin or vasopressin receptor antagonists have also shown some promise in improving core ASD symptoms. The use of vitamins, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements in conjunction with pharmacological and behavioral treatment appear to have some effect in symptomatic improvement in ASD, though additional studies are needed to confirm these benefits.

The present paper explores whether an affective bias in verbal memory is associated with recurrence of mood episodes in patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD). METHOD: 76 euthymic adult patients with BD were randomly assigned to either 9 months of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Support Therapy (ST), and followed up for 2 years after completing therapy. At baseline, affective learning memory (Emotional Auditory Verbal Learning Test; EMO-AVLT) and other measures were assessed. Recurrence of a mood episode was the primary outcome. RESULTS: The survival analyses revealed that the interaction between therapy condition, more specifically ST, and a recognition bias in favor of mania-related, but not depression-related words predicted recurrence of mania. Recurrence of depression was predicted by neither affective memory bias nor their interaction with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A mania-related memory bias emerged as a predictor of mania recurrence, specifically in an unstructured setting such as ST. Perhaps mania-related schemata are more salient or more easily activated in those at high risk for recurrence.

Preventive cognitive therapy (PCT) has been proposed as an alternative to maintenance antidepressant treatment, but whether its addition would allow tapering of antidepressants or enhance the efficacy of maintenance antidepressant treatment is unclear. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of antidepressants alone, with PCT while tapering off antidepressants, or PCT added to antidepressants in the prevention of relapse and recurrence. METHODS: In this single-blind, multicentre, parallel, three-group, randomised controlled trial, individuals recruited by general practitioners, pharmacists, secondary mental health care, or media were randomly assigned (10:10:8) to PCT and antidepressants, antidepressants alone, or PCT with tapering of antidepressants, using computer-generated randomised allocation stratified for number of previous depressive episodes and type of care. Eligible participants had previously experienced at least two depressive episodes and were in remission or recovery on antidepressants, which they had been receiving for at least the past 6 months. Exclusion criteria were current mania or hypomania, a history of bipolar disorder, any history of psychosis, current alcohol or drug abuse, an anxiety disorder that requires treatment, psychological treatment more than twice a month, and a diagnosis of organic brain damage.

FINDINGS: Between July 14, 2009, and April 30, 2015, 2486 participants were assessed for eligibility and 289 were randomly assigned to PCT and antidepressant (n=104), antidepressant alone (n=100), or PCT with tapering of antidepressant (n=85). The overall log-rank test was significant (p=0·014). Antidepressants alone were not superior to PCT while tapering off antidepressants in terms of the risk of relapse or recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 0·86, 95% CI 0·56-1·32; p=0·502). Adding PCT to antidepressant treatment resulted in a 41% relative risk reduction compared with antidepressants alone (0·59, 0·38-0·94; p=0·026). There were two suicide attempts (one in the antidepressants alone group and one in the PCT with tapering of antidepressants group) and one death (in the PCT and antidepressants group) not related to the interventions during the 24 months' follow-up. INTERPRETATION: Maintenance antidepressant treatment is not superior to PCT after recovery, whereas adding PCT to antidepressant treatment after recovery is superior to antidepressants alone. PCT should be offered to recurrently depressed individuals on antidepressants and to individuals who wish to stop antidepressants after recovery.

Pharmacological treatments for BD might further aggravate cognitive impairment, highlighting the need of developing interventions that present cognitive safety. In this study, we evaluated the cognitive effects of H1-coil (deep) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. METHODS: Fourty-three patients were randomized to receive 20 sessions of active (55 trains, 18â¯Hz, 120% resting motor threshold intensity) or sham rTMS within a double-blind, sham-controlled trial. A battery of 20 neuropsychological assessments, grouped in 6 domains (attention and processing speed, working memory and executive function, inhibitory control, language, immediate verbal memory, and long-term verbal memory) was performed at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of trial onset. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. RESULTS: Cognitive improvement was shown for all cognitive domains. It occurred regardless of intervention group and depression improvement. For the language domain, greater improvement was observed in the sham group over time. No correlations between depression (at baseline or during treatment) and cognitive improvement were found. LIMITATIONS: Absence of healthy control group. CONCLUSION: The results of this exploratory study provide evidence on the cognitive safety of H1-coil TMS for BD patients.

Mindfulness and acceptance-based cognitive and behavioural therapies (or 'third -wave' CBT) may prove fruitful due to the considerable overlap between these approaches and key features of personal recovery. Groups also confer therapeutic benefits consistent with personal recovery and may improve recovery-oriented service provision by adding another modality for accessing support. The primary objective of this trial is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a new recovery-focused group therapy (RfGT) intervention for adults with BD. This is the first published feasibility assessment of a time-limited RfGTrecovery-focused group therapy intervention for BD. METHODS/ ANALYSIS: This protocol describes an open feasibility study, utilising a pre-treatment design versus post- treatment design and nested qualitative evaluation. Participants will be recruited from the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia, from primary care providers, specialist mental health services, non-government organisations and via self-referral. The primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability as indexed by recruitment, retention, intervention adherence, adverse events (if any) and detailed consumer feedback. Clinical outcomes and process measures will be assessed to inform future research. Primary outcome data will utiliseuse descriptive statistics (eg, summarizingsummarising recruitment, demographics, attendance, attrition and intervention adherence). Secondary outcomes will be assessed using repeated-measures analysis of covariance across all time points (including change, effect size and variability).

We aimed to evaluate the effects of a primary care intervention on decreasing total cholesterol concentrations and cardiovascular disease risk in people with severe mental illnesses. METHODS: We did this cluster randomised trial in general practices across England, with general practices as the cluster unit. We randomly assigned general practices (1:1) with 40 or more patients with severe mental illnesses using a computer-generated random sequence with a block size of four. Researchers were masked to allocation, but patients and general practice staff were not. We included participants aged 30-75 years with severe mental illnesses (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or psychosis), who had raised cholesterol concentrations (5·0 mmol/L) or a total:HDL cholesterol ratio of 4·0 mmol/L or more and one or more modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors. Eligible participants were recruited within each practice before randomisation. The Primrose intervention consisted of appointments (&#8804;12) with a trained primary care professional involving manualised interventions for cardiovascular disease prevention (ie, adhering to statins, improving diet or physical activity levels, reducing alcohol, or quitting smoking). Treatment as usual involved feedback of screening results only. The primary outcome was total cholesterol at 12 months and the primary economic analysis outcome was health-care costs. We used intention-to-treat analysis. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN13762819. FINDINGS: Between Dec 10, 2013, and Sept 30, 2015, we recruited general practices and between May 9, 2014, and Feb 10, 2016, we recruited participants and randomly assigned 76 general practices with 327 participants to the Primrose intervention (n=38 with 155 patients) or treatment as usual (n=38 with 172 patients). Total cholesterol concentration data were available at 12 months for 137 (88%) participants in the Primrose intervention group and 152 (88%) participants in the treatment-as-usual group. The mean total cholesterol concentration did not differ at 12 months between the two groups (5·4 mmol/L [SD 1·1] for Primrose vs 5·5 mmol/L [1·1] for treatment as usual; mean difference estimate 0·03, 95% CI -0·22 to 0·29; p=0·788). This result was unchanged by pre-agreed supportive analyses. Mean cholesterol decreased over 12 months (-0·22 mmol/L [1·1] for Primrose vs -0·36 mmol/L [1·1] for treatment as usual). Total health-care costs (£1286 [SE 178] in the Primrose intervention group vs £2182 [328] in the treatment-as-usual group; mean difference -£895, 95% CI -1631 to -160; p=0·012) and psychiatric inpatient costs (£157 [135] vs £956 [313]; -£799, -1480 to -117; p=0·018) were lower in the Primrose intervention group than the treatment-as-usual group. Six serious adverse events of hospital admission and one death occurred in the Primrose group (n=7) and 23, including three deaths, occurred in the treatment-as-usual group (n=18). INTERPRETATION: Total cholesterol concentration at 12 months did not differ between the Primrose and treatment-as-usual groups, possibly because of the cluster design, good care in the treatment-as-usual group, short duration of the intervention, or suboptimal focus on statin prescribing. The association between the Primrose intervention and fewer psychiatric admissions, with potential cost-effectiveness, might be important.

To address this gap, we will: (1) conduct a systematic review (SR) to answer the question 'among eligible PGs relevant to the prevention or treatment of CYMH conditions, which PGs meet criteria for minimum and high quality?'; (2) apply nominal group methods to create recommendations for how CYMH PG quality, completeness and usefulness can be strengthened. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: SR: Potentially eligible PGs will be identified in 12 databases using a reproducible search strategy developed by a research librarian. Trained raters will: (1) apply prespecified criteria to identify eligible PGs relevant to depression, anxiety, suicidality, bipolar disorder, behaviour disorder (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder) and substance use disorder; (2) extract descriptive data and (3) assess PG quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool. Scores on three AGREE II domains (rigour of development, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence) will designate PGs as minimum (&#8805;50%) or high quality (&#8805;70%).

GSK-3 may be a relevant treatment target for interventions tailored at cognitive disturbances in BD but the relation between GSK-3 activity, cognition and lithium treatment is unknown. We therefore investigated the possible association between GSK-3 activity and cognition and whether lithium treatment moderates this association in patients with BD. In a prospective 6-12 month follow-up study, GSK- 3ß activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured concurrently with cognitive performance assessed using a comprehensive test battery in 27 patients with BD-I in early and late remission following a manic or mixed episode. The GSK-3ß activity, measured as serine-9 phosphorylated GSK-3ß (pGSK-3ß) and the GSK-3ß ratio (serine-9-pGSK-3ß /total GSK-3ß), was negatively associated with sustained attention (p = 0.009 and p = 0.042, respectively), but not with other cognitive domains or global cognition. A crossover interaction between lithium treatment and the GSK activity was observed, indicating that lower pGSK-3ß levels (p = 0.015) and GSK ratio (p = 0.010) were associated with better global cognition in lithium users whereas the opposite association was observed in non-lithium treated patients. Findings were not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. In conclusion, cognitive functioning may be associated with GSK-3 activity in patients with BD-I and lithium treatment may modulate this relationship.

The impact of premorbid IQ on prevalence was examined, and the influence of treatment response. METHODS: Samples were: (i) 58 inpatients in a current severe depressive episode (unipolar or bipolar), (ii) 69 unmedicated outpatients in a mild to moderate depressive episode (unipolar or bipolar), (iii) 56 outpatients with bipolar disorder, in a depressive episode, and (iv) 63 outpatients with bipolar disorder, currently euthymic. Cognitive assessment was conducted after treatment in Studies 1 (6 weeks of antidepressant treatment commenced on admission) and 2 (16-week course of cognitive behaviour therapy or schema therapy), allowing the impact of treatment response to be assessed. All mood disorder samples were compared with healthy control groups. RESULTS: The prevalence of cognitive impairment was highest for the inpatient depression sample (Study 1), and lowest for the outpatient depression sample (Study 2). Substantial variability in rates was observed depending on the definition of impairment used. Correcting cognitive performance for premorbid IQ had a significant impact on the prevalence of cognitive impairment in the inpatient depression sample. There was minimal evidence that treatment response impacted on prevalence of cognitive impairment, except in the domain of psychomotor speed in inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: As interventions aiming to improve cognitive outcomes in mood disorders receive increasing research focus, the issue of setting a cut-off level of cognitive impairment for screening purposes becomes a priority. This analysis demonstrates important differences in samples likely to be recruited depending on the definition of cognitive impairment and begins to examine the importance of premorbid IQ in determining who is impaired.",20180119,20,3,10.1111/bdi.12602,1399-5618

We also examined whether exploratory verbal memory, executive functioning, and neural correlates of verbal memory during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) predicted change in depression severity. METHODS: Thirty-two adults (ages 18-65) with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder meeting current criteria for a major depressive episode were randomized to 18 weeks of CBT or SP. Symptom severity was assessed before, at the mid-point, and after the 18-week intervention. All participants completed a brief pre-treatment neuropsychological testing battery (including the California Verbal Learning Test-2nd Edition, Delis Kaplan Executive Functioning System [DKEFS] Trail-making Test, and DKEFS Sorting Test), and a sub-set of 17 participants provided usable fMRI data while completing a verbal learning paradigm that consisted of encoding word lists. RESULTS: CBT and SP yielded comparable improvement in depressive symptoms from pre- to post-treatment. Better retention of learned information (CVLT-II long delay free recall vs. Trial 5) and recognition (CVLT-II hits) were associated with greater improvement in depression in both treatments. Increased activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right hippocampus during encoding was also related to depressive symptom improvement.

However, this treatment has not yet been directly compared with a first-line PTSD treatment such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT). Objective: To determine if WET is noninferior to CPT in patients with PTSD. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this randomized clinical trial conducted at a Veterans Affairs medical facility between February 28, 2013, and November 6, 2016, 126 veteran and nonveteran adults were randomized to either WET or CPT. Inclusion criteria were a primary diagnosis of PTSD and stable medication therapy. Exclusion criteria included current psychotherapy for PTSD, high risk of suicide, diagnosis of psychosis, and unstable bipolar illness. Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Interventions: Participants assigned to CPT (n = 63) received 12 sessions and participants assigned to WET (n = 63) received 5 sessions. The CPT protocol that includes written accounts was delivered individually in 60-minute weekly sessions. The first WET session requires 60 minutes while the remaining 4 sessions require 40 minutes. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the total score on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5; noninferiority was defined by a score of 10 points. Blinded evaluations were conducted at baseline and 6, 12, 24, and 36 weeks after the first treatment session. Treatment dropout was also examined. Results: For the 126 participants (66 men and 60 women; mean [SD] age, 43.9 [14.6] years), improvements in PTSD symptoms in the WET condition were noninferior to improvements in the CPT condition at each of the assessment periods. The largest difference between treatments was observed at the 24-week assessment (mean difference, 4.31 points; 95% CI, -1.37 to 9.99). There were significantly fewer dropouts in the WET vs CPT condition (4 [6.4%] vs 25 [39.7%]; &#967;21 = 12.84, Cramer V = 0.40). Conclusions and Relevance: Although WET involves fewer sessions, it was noninferior to CPT in reducing symptoms of PTSD. The findings suggest that WET is an efficacious and efficient PTSD treatment that may reduce attrition and transcend previously observed barriers to PTSD treatment for both patients and providers.

The current study evaluated prevalence and correlates of NSSI, and its impact on intervention response, in a randomized trial of Child- and Family-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CFF-CBT) versus Treatment As Usual (TAU), adjunctive to pharmacotherapy. This study included 72 children ages 7-13 (58% male) with PBD. NSSI and correlates were assessed at baseline; mood and psychiatric severity were measured longitudinally. NSSI was common: 31% endorsed NSSI behaviors; 10% reported thoughts of NSSI, in the absence of behaviors. Children engaging in NSSI reported higher depression, psychosis, suicidality, and hopelessness; lower self-esteem; and reduced family help-seeking in univariate analyses. In a multivariate logistic regression, high child depression and psychosis, and low family help-seeking, remained significantly associated with baseline NSSI. In mixed-effects regression models, presence of NSSI at baseline did not influence the response of depressive symptoms to treatment. Children who endorsed NSSI experienced steeper response trajectories for psychiatric severity, regardless of treatment group. Youth who denied NSSI showed poorer response to TAU for manic symptoms; mania trajectories in CFF-CBT were similar across youth. Thus, NSSI in PBD is common and associated with impairment. As children might engage in NSSI for different reasons, the function of NSSI should be considered in treatment. Since children without NSSI fared worse in TAU, it may be important to ensure that youth with PBD receive structured, intensive interventions. CFF-CBT was efficacious regardless of NSSI, and thus shows promise for high-risk children with PBD.",20170721,46,4,10.1007/s10802-017-0331-4,1573-2835

In this study, we present metacognitive training (MCT) for bipolar disorder-an adaption of a group intervention that has proven effective in other severe psychiatric disorders. MCT is a structured, interactive approach that addresses cognitive biases, social cognition, and self-esteem. In this pilot study, we investigated psychosocial functioning as primary outcome measure, as well as the feasibility of MCT and its acceptance among bipolar patients. METHODS: Thirty-four outpatients with bipolar disorder were recruited. Inclusion criteria were euthymia and psychosocial functioning with a score >11 assessed by the Functional Assessment Short Test. The subjects received eight weekly MCT sessions. Before and after the intervention, psychosocial functioning, quality of life (QoL), and patient views were assessed. RESULTS: Patients improved significantly in global psychosocial functioning, with a large effect size from baseline to post-treatment. Over the intervention period, patient QoL improved significantly in terms of their physical health, however not for other QoL subdomains. Treatment adherence was 80%, and patients appraisal of the training was positive. LIMITATIONS: As this study lacks a control group, it is not possible to ascertain whether the positive treatment effects are attributable to MCT. Additionally, it is unclear whether gains in psychosocial functioning would have been maintained long term.

This study examined cytokines, mood symptoms, and sleep in individuals with interepisode BD with complaints of insomnia. We also investigated the effects of a BD-specific modification of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBTI-BP) on cytokine levels. METHODS: Twenty-two adults with interepisode BD type I and insomnia were drawn from a subset of a National Institute of Mental Health funded study. Participants were randomly allocated to CBTI-BP (n = 11) or psychoeducation (n = 11). Participants completed a sleep diary, rated self-report measures of mania and depression, and provided samples assayed for interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor soluble receptor 2 (sTNF-R2). RESULTS: IL-6 was associated with mania symptoms (rs = 0.44, p = .041) and total sleep time (rs = -0.49, p = .026). IL-6 was related to depression symptoms at the trend level (rs = 0.43, p = .052). sTNF-R2 was not significantly related to mood or sleep measures. From pretreatment to posttreatment, CBTI-BP compared with psychoeducation was associated with a nonsignificant, large effect size decrease in IL-6 (z = -1.61, p = .13, d = -0.78) and a nonsignificant, small-medium effect size decrease in sTNF-R2 (z = -0.79, p = .44, d = -0.38). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence that IL-6 is related to mania symptoms and shorter total sleep time in interepisode BD.

At the psychiatric unit of the University Hospital of Strasbourg, France, we have developed an open group that combines psychoeducation and cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), the information, discovery, exchange and mobilization for depression group (IDEM-depression). IDEM-depression is composed of 17 thematic, structured, and independent sessions, which address different aspects of depression (i.e., rumination, pharmacological treatments). Because of its flexible format, patients with varying degrees of depression severity (from remission up to severe depressive symptoms) and whose depression might be bipolar or unipolar, are able to participate in the group. Thus, the group is well suited to a large number of patients with major depression. In the present study we aimed at describing the IDEM-depression group and presenting results regarding patients overall satisfaction, assessed via two self-report questionnaires (the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, the CSQ-8, and the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire), as well as its effect on mood following each session assessed via a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 up to 100. METHOD: Sixty-five patients participated in 50 sessions of the IDEM-depression group in two hospitals in Alsace. 61% of the patients had bipolar disorder, and 41% of them were inpatients. Sessions took place on a weekly basis, lasted 2hours and were proposed by a CBT-trained clinical psychologist. Patients were asked to fill-out the VAS at the beginning and at the end of each session. Moreover, they were asked to fill-out the CSQ-8 and the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire when they left the group. Other than one session (yoga and mindfulness), all the sessions (16 out of 17) were structured on a Powerpoint© presentation. During the first hour information was given regarding the topic (i.e., rumination), and a shared CBT conceptualization of the topic was formulated by the participants and the psychologist. For most sessions, the first hour was therefore communication and information-based, whereas during the second hour participants were asked to participate in in-session behavioral experiments and/or to evaluate specific aspects of their behavior (thoughts, emotions, activity, mindful behavior) during the last few days. The therapist manual and the slides for each session are available via e-mail to the first author. RESULTS: Regarding the results, self-reported mood on the VAS was compared between the onset (225 VAS) and the end (225 VAS) of each session. Overall, results suggest that self-reported mood is significantly improved following the participation in sessions (t=-5. 87, P<0.001). Moreover, mean results on the CSQ-8 suggest that patients are highly satisfied with the group (M=24.46, SD=6.42). Among them, 82% reported a moderate-high satisfaction with the group. On the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire, patients reported an overall high satisfaction level regarding (i) the content of sessions, (ii) the duration of sessions, (iii) the frequency of sessions, (iv) how much they felt they could express themselves during sessions. In the qualitative comments of this questionnaire, patients reported that the group helped them to gain an understanding of the mechanisms involved in depression; to feel less isolated and guilty; and to learn about specific psychotherapeutic tools (i.e., mindfulness) and to try to implement them. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that an IDEM-depression group is well suited to a wide-array of clinical pictures associated with depression (varying severity, bipolar or unipolar, inpatients and outpatients). This is probably due to its open-group format which is particularly well-adapted to the dynamic symptomatology associated with major depression, and may stimulate decentering in patients who have different levels of severity of symptoms but participate in the same session. Moreover, its impact on mood improvement, and the high satisfaction level reported by patients, seem to be related to its CBT and psychoeducation-based content on the one hand, which has shown its efficacy in depression. On the other hand, IDEMs structured open-group format might have also contributed to the improvement in mood and the overall good satisfaction reported by patients, through the social support provided by the group, improved feeling of self-efficiency, and its effect on stigmatization. Thus, IDEM-depression group is an efficacious, flexible, low-cost, and easy to implement (in different clinical settings) psychotherapeutic option for major depression.",20161229,44,2,10.1016/j.encep.2016.09.004,0013-7006

The aim of this study is to detect the TRX levels in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), analyse the effect of rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) application on TRX levels and display the relationship of TRX with cognitive areas. This study included 27 treatment-resistant unipolar depression patients and 29 healthy subjects. Patients were evaluated by Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HARS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) before and after rTMS application. 23 of TRD patients were applied high-frequency rTMS over left DLPFC for 2 to 4weeks and plasma TRX levels of patients and healthy subjects were measured. No significant difference was determined between the TRX levels of patients and healthy subjects (p>0.05). After rTMS application there were significant decrease in severity of depression (p<0.001) and anxiety (p<0.001), and explicit improvement in cognitive areas (delayed memory, visual-spatial/executive abilities and language points) (all p<0.05). No difference was detected in TRX levels of the patients after rTMS application (p>0.005). High language scores of the patients were found to be associated with high TRX levels (p<0.005). Our study indicates that TRX levels cannot be used as a marker for TRD or rTMS treatment in TRD. In spite of this TRX levels have a positive correlation with language functions of the patients of TRD. More extensive studies are required to clarify the mechanism of action of TRX and the effect of TRX on cognitive functions.",20170427,80,Pt C,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.04.025,1878-4216

However, pragmatic trials and observational studies are needed to determine its real-world effectiveness, impact on outcomes deemed important to patients and to clarify potential mediators of any benefits. METHODS: Individuals with BD were offered the opportunity to participate in 20h of PE and asked to complete pre- and post-intervention ratings of symptoms, knowledge about BD, medication adherence, and illness perception. A priori, two key patient outcomes were identified (social functioning and self-esteem); sample attrition due to dropout or relapse was recorded. RESULTS: Of 156 individuals who completed the pre-PE assessments, 103 completed the program and post-PE assessments. Only 4 of 53 dropouts were associated with BD relapse. Post-intervention, the PE completers demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in social functioning (p = 0.003, Effect Size (ES) = 0.26) and a trend towards improved self-esteem (ES = 0.14).

METHODS: This assessor-blind parallel-group pilot trial randomised patients to receive sleep treatment at acute crisis [STAC, plus standard care (SC)], or SC alone (1 : 1). STAC included cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for insomnia, sleep monitoring and light/dark exposure for circadian entrainment, delivered over 2 weeks. Assessments took place at 0, 2, 4 and 12 weeks. Feasibility outcomes assessed recruitment, retention of participants and uptake of the therapy. Primary efficacy outcomes were the Insomnia Severity Index and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale at week 2. Analyses were intention-to-treat, estimating treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Between October 2015 and July 2016, 40 participants were recruited (from 43 assessed eligible).

METHODS: We enrolled 19 participants with MDD, who received 15 weekly sessions of full CBT, including two sessions for IR of intrusive images and, separately, for memory rescripting. Before and after the IR intervention, participants were asked to rate the intrusive images they experienced against, an intrusion index that included difficulty (interference with daily life), uncontrollability, distress caused by the negative image, and vividness. We recorded the contents of each participant's negative and positive imagery to classify these. RESULTS: The intrusion index scores decreased after the IR sessions. Negative images experienced by the participants while in a depressive mood were categorized into three different types: blame, social exclusion, and loneliness.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) to monitor cognitive changes in patients with depression receiving ECT. Cognitive functioning was assessed prospectively in 48 patients with unipolar or bipolar depression before and after an ECT course. ECT-induced cognitive impairments were defined as a decrease of at least 2 points on the MoCA and the MMSE total scores and of at least one point on each sub-score. At baseline, the MoCA detected a higher number of patients with cognitive deficits than the MMSE. After ECT, the MoCA and MMSE total scores were comparable, but the MoCA detected more impairments than did the MMSE for visuo-executive, memory and language subscores. ECT significantly decreased the language capacities but improved the visuo-executive and abstraction performances measured by MoCA. In remitters, the MoCA total score and visuo-executive and abstraction performances were significantly improved, while other cognitive functions remained unchanged.

This study examined whether abstinence-contingent monetary incentives improved outcomes when added to cessation treatments at community mental health centers: prescriber visit for pharmacotherapy only (PV only), prescriber visit and facilitated quitline (PV+Q), and prescriber visit and telephone cognitive-behavioral therapy (PV+CBT). METHODS: During 2012-2015, a total of 1,468 adult, daily smoking Medicaid beneficiaries with mental illnesses received Web-based motivational tobacco education. Eligible participants who wanted cessation treatment (N=661) were randomly assigned to treatment with or without abstinence-contingent incentives for four weeks after a quit attempt and assessed for biologically verified abstinence at three, six, nine, and 12 months. To examine intervention effect on abstinence over time, logistic generalized linear models estimated with generalized estimating equations were used, with missing observations imputed as smoking. RESULTS: Participants included smokers with schizophrenia disorders (N=148), bipolar disorder (N=150), major depressive disorder (N=158), and anxiety and other disorders (N=205). There was no significant effect of intervention (PV only, PV+Q, and PV+CBT). However, participants who received monetary incentives were more likely to be abstinent from smoking over time (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.77, p=.009). Post hoc comparisons indicated greater abstinence at 12 months in PV+Q with incentives than in PV+Q without incentives (14% versus 4% abstinent, AOR=3.94, p=.014).

Homer is a target for antidepressants and mood stabilizers. The AA risk genotype of the Homer rs7713917 A>G SNP has been associated with mood disorders and suicide, and in healthy humans with brain function. Despite the evidence linking Homer 1 gene and function to mood disorder, as well as its involvement in animal models of depression, no study has yet investigated the role of Homer in bipolar depression and treatment response. METHODS: We studied 199 inpatients, affected by a major depressive episode in course of BD. 147 patients were studied with structural MRI of grey and white matter, and 50 with BOLD functional MRI of emotional processing. 158 patients were treated with combined total sleep deprivation and light therapy. RESULTS: At neuroimaging, patients with the AA genotype showed lower grey matter volumes in medial prefrontal cortex, higher BOLD fMRI neural responses to emotional stimuli in anterior cingulate cortex, and lower fractional anisotropy in bilateral frontal WM tracts. Lithium treatment increased axial diffusivity more in AA patients than in G*carriers. At clinical evaluation, the same AA homozygotes showed a worse antidepressant response to combined SD and LT. CONCLUSIONS: rs7713917 influenced brain grey and white matter structure and function in BD, long term effects of lithium on white matter structure, and antidepressant response to chronotherapeutics, thus suggesting that glutamatergic neuroplasticity and Homer 1 function might play a role in BD psychopathology and response to treatment.",20171029,81,,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.10.011,1878-4216

METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, in-patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression were randomized to either algorithm-based pharmacologic treatment or right unilateral electroconvulsive therapy. After the 6-week treatment period, all of the patients received maintenance pharmacotherapy as recommended by their clinician guided by a relevant treatment algorithm. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 6 months. Neurocognitive functions were assessed using the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery, and autobiographical memory consistency was assessed using the Autobiographical Memory Interview-Short Form. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients entered the trial, of whom 51 and 26 completed neurocognitive assessments at baseline and 6 months, respectively. The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery composite score improved by 4.1 points in both groups (P = .042) from baseline to 6 months (from 40.8 to 44.9 and from 41.9 to 46.0 in the algorithm-based pharmacologic treatment and electroconvulsive therapy groups, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find that right unilateral electroconvulsive therapy caused long-term impairment in neurocognitive functions compared to algorithm-based pharmacologic treatment in bipolar depression as measured using standard neuropsychological tests, but due to the low number of patients in the study the results should be interpreted with caution.

However, numbers of well controlled studies are low and neurofeedback techniques are regarded as highly controversial. The present trial examined the efficacy (compared with sham neurofeedback) and efficiency (compared with meta-cognitive therapy) of a standard EEG neurofeedback protocol in adults with ADHD. METHODS: We did a concurrent, triple-blind, randomised, controlled trial using authorised deception in adults with ADHD from one centre (University of Tübingen) in Tübingen, Germany. Participants were eligible if they fulfilled the DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD, were aged between 18 years and 60 years, and had no or stable use of medication for at least 2 months with no intention to change. We excluded participants who had comorbid schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, epilepsy, or traumatic brain injury; substance abuse or dependence; or current or planned other psychological treatment. Those eligible were randomly assigned to three groups: a neurofeedback group which received 30 verum Î¸-to-ß neurofeedback sessions over 15 weeks, a sham neurofeedback group which received 15 sham followed by 15 verum Î¸-to-ß neurofeedback sessions over 15 weeks, or a meta-cognitive group therapy group which received 12 sessions over 12 weeks. Participants were assigned equally to one of the three interventions through a computerised minimisation randomisation procedure stratified by sex, age, and baseline symptom severity of ADHD. Participants were masked as to whether they were receiving neurofeedback or sham neurofeedback, but those receiving meta-cognitive therapy were aware of their treatment. Clinical assessors (ie, those assessing outcomes) and research staff who did the neurofeedback training were masked to participants' randomisation status only for neurofeedback and sham neurofeedback. The primary outcome was symptom score on the Conners' adult ADHD rating scale, assessed before treatment, at midtreatment (after 8 weeks), after treatment (after 16 weeks), and 6 months later. All individuals with at least one observation after randomisation were included in the analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01883765. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2013, and Dec 1, 2015, 761 people were assessed for eligibility. 656 (86%) were excluded and 118 (15%) were eligible for participation in this study. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to neurofeedback (38 [32%]), sham neurofeedback (39 [33%]), or meta-cognitive therapy (41 [35%]). 37 (97%) individuals for neurofeedback, 38 (97%) for sham neurofeedback, and 38 (93%) for meta-cognitive therapy were included in analyses. Self-reported ADHD symptoms decreased substantially for all treatment groups (B=-2·58 [95% CI -3·48 to -1·68]; p<0·0001) between pretreatment and the end of 6 month follow-up, independent of treatment condition (neurofeedback vs sham neurofeedback B=-0·89 [95% CI -2·14 to 0·37], p=0·168; neurofeedback vs meta-cognitive therapy -0·30 [-1·55 to 0·95], p=0·639). No treatment-related or trial-related serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that neurofeedback training is not superior to a sham condition or group psychotherapy. All three treatments were equivalently effective in reducing ADHD symptoms. This first randomised, sham-controlled trial did not show any specific effects of neurofeedback on ADHD symptoms in adults.

However, it remains unknown whether lithium has a central role in cognition and functional outcome. We examined whether cognition and functional outcome were predicted by demographic and clinical variables, including the response to lithium, in lithium-treated patients with bipolar disorder. METHODS: We evaluated 96 lithium-treated euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and 196 age- and-gender-matched healthy controls, using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). The patients were also assessed using the Social Functioning Scale (SFS) and The Retrospective Criteria of Long-Term Treatment Response in Research Subjects with Bipolar Disorder (Alda) scale, which was evaluated as either a continuous measure of the total scale or a dichotomous criterion. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis revealed two key findings: first, that the premorbid intelligence quotient, age, and number of mood episodes were predictors of the BACS composite score; and, second, that the BACS composite score, negative symptoms, and continuous measure on the total Alda scale (but not its dichotomy) predicted the total SFS score. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to confirm these findings, and additionally revealed that the Alda scale was significantly associated with negative symptoms and also the number of mood episodes, regardless of how it was evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: SEM delineated how demographic and clinical variables, cognitive performance, and response to lithium treatment were causally associated with, and converged on, social function.

In the context of a trial evaluating a smartphone application delivering personalized psychoeducational contents for BD (SIMPLe 1.0), the main aim of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of SIMPLe 1.0 in BR regulation using the BRIAN scale. METHODS: 51 remitted BD patients were asked to use the application for 3 months. Paired t-test analyses were employed to compare baseline and follow-up BRIAN´s total and domains scores. The sample was divided into completers and non-completers of the study to evaluate differences between groups regarding BRIAN scores using ANCOVA analyses. RESULTS: The BRIAN's mean total score of the whole sample significantly decreased from baseline to post-intervention (35.89 (SD 6.64) vs. 31.18 (SD 6.33), t = 4.29, p = 0.001).

The goal of this study was to compare implicit motor sequence learning in BD and SZ. METHODS: We examined 33 patients with BD, 33 patients with SZ and 31 healthy controls with a use of ambidextrous Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT), which allows exploring asymmetries in performance depending on the hand used. RESULTS: BD and SZ patients presented impaired implicit motor sequence learning, although the pattern of their impairments was different. While BD patients showed no signs of implicit motor sequence learning for both hands, the SZ group presented some features of motor learning when performing with the right, but not with the left hand. CONCLUSIONS: To our best knowledge this is the first study comparing implicit motor sequence learning in BD and SZ. We show that both diseases share impairments in this domain, however in the case of SZ this impairment differs dependently on the hand performing SRTT. We propose that implicit motor sequence learning impairments constitute an overlapping symptom in BD and SZ and suggest further neuroimaging studies to verify cerebellar underpinnings as its cause.",20170627,79,Pt B,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.06.025,1878-4216

Among these, costs due to psychiatric hospitalization are a major burden. Smartphones comprise an innovative and unique platform for the monitoring and treatment of depression and mania. No prior trial has investigated whether the use of a smartphone-based system can prevent re-admission among patients discharged from hospital. The present RADMIS trials aim to investigate whether using a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system, including an integrated clinical feedback loop, reduces the rate and duration of re-admissions more than standard treatment in unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder. METHODS: The RADMIS trials use a randomized controlled, single-blind, parallel-group design. Patients with unipolar disorder and patients with bipolar disorder are invited to participate in each trial when discharged from psychiatric hospitals in The Capital Region of Denmark following an affective episode and randomized to either (1) a smartphone-based monitoring system including (a) an integrated feedback loop between patients and clinicians and (b) context-aware cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules (intervention group) or (2) standard treatment (control group) for a 6-month trial period. The trial started in May 2017. The outcomes are (1) number and duration of re-admissions (primary), (2) severity of depressive and manic (only for patients with bipolar disorder) symptoms; psychosocial functioning; number of affective episodes (secondary), and (3) perceived stress, quality of life, self-rated depressive symptoms, self-rated manic symptoms (only for patients with bipolar disorder), recovery, empowerment, adherence to medication, wellbeing, ruminations, worrying, and satisfaction (tertiary). A total of 400 patients (200 patients with unipolar disorder and 200 patients with bipolar disorder) will be included in the RADMIS trials. DISCUSSION: If the smartphone-based monitoring system proves effective in reducing the rate and duration of re-admissions, there will be basis for using a system of this kind in the treatment of unipolar and bipolar disorder in general and on a larger scale.

Treating anxiety in the context of BD is crucial for improving illness course and outcomes. The current study examined the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the Unified Protocol (UP), a transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy, as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for BD and comorbid anxiety disorders. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with BD and at least one comorbid anxiety disorder were randomized to pharmacotherapy treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU with 18 sessions of the UP (UP+TAU). All patients completed assessments every four weeks to track symptoms, functioning, emotion regulation and temperament. Linear mixed-model regressions were conducted to track symptom changes over time and to examine the relationship between emotion-related variables and treatment response. RESULTS: Satisfaction ratings were equivalent for both treatment groups. Patients in the UP+TAU group evidenced significantly greater reductions over time in anxiety and depression symptoms (Cohen's d's>0.80). Baseline levels of neuroticism, perceived affective control, and emotion regulation ability predicted magnitude of symptom change for the UP+TAU group only. Greater change in perceived control of emotions and emotion regulation skills predicted greater change in anxiety related symptoms. LIMITATIONS: This was a pilot feasibility and acceptability trial; results should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the UP+TAU was rated high in patient satisfaction, and resulted in significantly greater improvement on indices of anxiety and depression relative to TAU. This suggests that the UP may be a feasible treatment approach for BD with comorbid anxiety.",20170604,219,,10.1016/j.jad.2017.05.011,1573-2517

While phase I monitoring often demonstrates a preponderance of unilateral findings, individual studies (video EEG, single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], and positron emission tomography [PET]) can suggest or fail to exclude a contralateral epileptogenic onset zone. This study describes previously unreported techniques of trans-falcine and sub-frontal insertion of contralateral SD grids and depth electrodes for phase II monitoring in pediatric epilepsy surgery patients when concern about bilateral abnormalities has been elicited during phase I monitoring. METHODS: Pediatric patients with medically refractory epilepsy undergoing stage I surgery for phase II monitoring involving sub-frontal and/or trans-falcine insertion of SD grids and/or depth electrodes at the senior author's institution were retrospectively reviewed. Intra-operative technical details of sub-frontal and trans-falcine approaches were studied, while intra-operative complications or events were noted. Operative techniques included gentle subfrontal retraction and elevation of the olfactory tracts (while preserving the relationship between the olfactory bulb and cribriform plate) to insert SD grids across the midline for coverage of the contralateral orbito-frontal regions. Trans-falcine approaches involved accessing the inter-hemispheric space, bipolar cauterization of the anterior falx cerebri below the superior sagittal sinus, and sharp dissection using a blunt elevator and small blade scalpel. The falcine window allowed contralateral SD strip, grid, and depth electrodes to be inserted for coverage of the contralateral frontal regions. RESULTS: The study cohort included seven patients undergoing sub-frontal and/or trans-falcine insertion of contralateral SD strip, grid, and/or depth electrodes from February 2012 through June 2015. Five patients (71%) experienced no intra-operative events related to contralateral ICEEG electrode insertion. Intra-operative events of frontal territory venous engorgement (1/7, 14%) due to sacrifice of anterior bridging veins draining into the SSS and avulsion of a contralateral bridging vein (1/7, 14%), probably due to prior anterior corpus callosotomy, each occurred in one patient. There were no intra-operative or peri-operative complications in any of the patients studied. Two patients required additional surgery for supplemental SD strip and/or depth electrodes via burr hole craniectomy to enhance phase II monitoring. All patients proceeded to stage II surgery for resection of ipsilateral epileptogenic onset zones without adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Trans-falcine and sub-frontal insertion of contralateral SD strip, grid, and depth electrodes are previously unreported techniques for achieving bilateral frontal coverage in phase II monitoring in pediatric epilepsy surgery. This technique obviates the need for contralateral craniotomy and parenchymal exposure with limited, remediable risks.

In the last 20 years or so, adjunctive psychological interventions been studied with the purpose of decreasing recurrences, stabilising the course of the disease, and improving the functionality in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the psychological effect of a multimodal intervention (MI) vs a traditional intervention (TI) program in BD I and schizophrenic patients. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal, therapeutic-comparative study was conducted with 302 patients (104 schizophrenic and 198 bipolar patients) who were randomly assigned to the MI or TI groups of a multimodal intervention program PRISMA. The MI group received care from psychiatry, general medicine, neuropsychology, family therapy, and occupational therapy. The TI group received care from psychiatry and general medicine. The Hamilton and Young scales, and the Scales for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Postive Symptoms (SAPS) were used on bipolar and schizophrenic patients, respectively. The scales AQ-12, TEMPS-A, FAST, Zuckerman sensation seeking scale, BIS-11, SAI-E and EEAG were applied to measure the psychological variables. The scales were performed before and after the interventions. The psychotherapy used in this study was cognitive behavioural therapy. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in socio-demographic and clinical variables in the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder group. There were no statistically significant differences in the psychological scales after conducting a multivariate analysis between the intervention groups and for both times (initial and final). CONCLUSION: This study did not show any changes in variables of psychological functioning variables between bipolar and schizophrenic groups, who were subjected to TI vs MI (who received cognitive behavioural therapy).

Prediction models limited to psychiatric phenomenology have insufficient predictive power. Herein, we aimed to evaluate whether the presence of overweight/obesity is associated with greater cognitive decline in individuals at high risk (HR) or ultra high risk (UHR) for BD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis to investigate the moderational role of body mass index (BMI) on measures of cognitive function. Subjects between the ages of 8 and 28 years with a positive family history of BD were compared to age-matched controls with a negative family history of BD. Subjects with at least one biological parent with bipolar I/II disorder were further stratified into UHR or HR status by the presence or absence, respectively, of subthreshold hypomanic, major depressive, attenuated psychotic, and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 36 individuals at HR for BD, 33 individuals at UHR for BD, and 48 age-matched controls were included in the analysis. Higher BMI was significantly associated with lower performance on measures of processing speed (i.e. Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia-symbol coding: r=-.186, P=.047) and attention/vigilance (i.e. Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs: r=-.257, P=.006). There were trends for negative correlations between BMI and measures of working memory (i.e. Wechsler Memory Scale-III Spatial Span: r=-0.177, P=.059) and overall cognitive function (i.e. Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia composite score: r=-.157, P=.097). Negative associations between BMI and cognitive performance were significantly stronger in the UHR group than in the HR group, when compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals at varying degrees of risk for BD exhibit greater cognitive impairment as a function of co-existing overweight/obesity. Prediction models for BD may be substantively informed by including information related to overweight/obesity and, perhaps, other general medical conditions that share pathology with BD. Our findings herein, as well as the salutary effects of bariatric surgery on measures of cognitive function in obese populations, provide the rationale for hypothesizing that mitigating excess weight in individuals at elevated risk for BD may forestall or prevent declaration of illness.",20170512,19,2,10.1111/bdi.12491,1399-5618

The present review and meta-analysis evaluated the treatment outcomes of patients with BD treated with CBT plus medication and compared these data with the outcomes of those who received standard care alone. METHODS: Electronic searches from inception to July 31, 2016, were performed using PubMed, Medline OVID, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL plus, and PsycINFO. In the extensive electronic literature search, keywords such as bipolar disorder, manic-depressive psychosis, bipolar affective disorder,bipolar depression,cognitive therapy,cognitive-behavioral therapy, and psychotherapy were transformed into MeSH terms, and only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) of relapse rates and Hedges's g, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for the mean differences in the levels of depression, mania, and psychosocial functioning were calculated. Further subgroup analyses were conducted according to the characteristics of the CBT approaches, patients, and therapists, if the data were available. RESULT: A total of 19 RCTs comprising 1384 patients with type I or II BD were enrolled in our systematic review and meta-analysis. The main analysis revealed that CBT could lower the relapse rate (pooled OR = 0.506; 95% CI = 0.278 -0.921) and improve depressive symptoms (g = -0.494; 95% CI = -0.963 to -0.026), mania severity (g = -0.581; 95% CI = -1.127 to -0.035), and psychosocial functioning (g = 0.457; 95% CI = 0.106-0.809). CONCLUSIONS: CBT is effective in decreasing the relapse rate and improving depressive symptoms, mania severity, and psychosocial functioning, with a mild-to-moderate effect size. Subgroup analyses indicated that improvements in depression or mania are more potent with a CBT treatment duration of &#8805;90 min per session, and the relapse rate is much lower among patients with type I BD.",20170505,12,5,10.1371/journal.pone.0176849,1932-6203

It aimed at documenting sustained mindfulness practice, perceived long-term benefit from the program, and changes regarded as direct consequences of the intervention. DESIGN: This cross-sectional survey took place at least 2 years after MBCT for 70.4% of participants. LOCATION: It was conducted in two specialized outpatient units for BDs that are part of the Geneva University Hospitals (Switzerland) and the Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris (France). SUBJECTS: Eligibility criteria were a diagnosis of BD according to DSM-IV and participation in at least four MBCT sessions. Response rate was 66.4%. The final sample included 71 outpatients (71.8% bipolar I, 28.2% bipolar II). OUTCOME MEASURES: A questionnaire retrospectively assessed patient-perceived change, benefit from MBCT, and current mindfulness practice. RESULTS: Proportions of respondents who practiced mindfulness at least once a week were 54.9% for formal practice (body scan, sitting meditation, mindful walking, or movements) and 57.7% for informal practice (mindful daily activities). Perceived benefit for the prevention of relapse was moderate, but patients acknowledged long-lasting effects and persistent changes in their way of life. Formal mindfulness practice at least once a week tended to be associated with increased long-lasting effects (p = 0.052), whereas regular informal practice and mindful breathing were significantly associated with persistent changes in daily life (p = 0.038) and better prevention of depressive relapse (p = 0.035), respectively. The most frequently reported positive change was increased awareness of being able to improve one's health.

Objective: To examine whether a pediatrics-based behavioral intervention targeting anxiety and depression improves clinical outcome compared with referral to outpatient community mental health care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 2-center randomized clinical trial with masked outcome assessment conducted between brief behavioral therapy (BBT) and assisted referral to care (ARC) studied 185 youths (aged 8.0-16.9 years) from 9 pediatric clinics in San Diego, California, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, recruited from October 6, 2010, through December 5, 2014. Youths who met DSM-IV criteria for full or probable diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, major depression, dysthymic disorder, and/or minor depression; lived with a consenting legal guardian for at least 6 months; and spoke English were included in the study. Exclusions included receipt of alternate treatment for anxiety or depression, presence of a suicidal plan, bipolar disorder, psychosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance dependence, current abuse, intellectual disability, or unstable serious physical illness. Interventions: The BBT consisted of 8 to 12 weekly 45-minute sessions of behavioral therapy delivered in pediatric clinics by master's-level clinicians. The ARC families received personalized referrals to mental health care and check-in calls to support accessing care from master's-level coordinators. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was clinically significant improvement on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (score &#8804;2). Secondary outcomes included the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised, and functioning. Results: A total of 185 patients were enrolled in the study (mean [SD] age, 11.3 [2.6] years; 107 [57.8%] female; 144 [77.8%] white; and 38 [20.7%] Hispanic). Youths in the BBT group (n = 95), compared with those in the ARC group (n = 90), had significantly higher rates of clinical improvement (56.8% vs 28.2%; &#967;21 = 13.09, P < .001; number needed to treat, 4), greater reductions in symptoms (F2,146 = 5.72; P = .004; Cohen f = 0.28), and better functioning (mean [SD], 68.5 [10.7] vs 61.9 [11.9]; t156 = 3.64; P < .001; Cohen d = 0.58). Ethnicity moderated outcomes, with Hispanic youth having substantially stronger response to BBT (76.5%) than ARC (7.1%) (&#967;21 = 14.90; P < .001; number needed to treat, 2). Effects were robust across sites. Conclusions and Relevance: A pediatric-based brief behavioral intervention for anxiety and depression is associated with benefits superior to those of assisted referral to outpatient mental health care. Effects were especially strong for Hispanic participants, suggesting that the protocol may be a useful tool in addressing ethnic disparities in care.

Yet in part because most children are seen in primary care, these illnesses are often not recognized or treated in a timely fashion. To begin to address this problem, we started the Child Network. METHODS: The Child Network is for parents of children age 2-12 with mood or behavioral symptoms or at high risk for them. The parents rate the severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional behavior, and mania on a once a week basis on a secure website under a Johns Hopkins Intramural Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol. These ratings can then be printed out along with any treatments given to aide in visualization of symptom course. A demographics form, which includes diagnoses given to the child in the community, and a symptom checklist are filled out upon Network entry. We report on the retrospective diagnoses and prospective treatment of the first 65 parents to join the Network. RESULTS: The most common diagnoses were anxiety disorders and ADHD followed by disruptive behavioral disorders and bipolar spectrum disorders. Prospective ratings of two or more consecutive weeks of moderate to severe rating in any of the five symptom domains paralleled these diagnoses given in the community. Atypical antipsychotics, anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, and medications for ADHD were among the most widely used drugs. An illustrated example of symptom course is presented. DISCUSSION: Many children continued to show substantial symptom severity despite treatment with an average of 2.2 medications. The Child Network provides a useful longitudinal approach to visualize the course of symptoms, which should help lead to earlier and more effective treatment.",20170426,27,9,10.1089/cap.2017.0002,1557-8992

New interventions have attempted to improve cognitive functioning in BD patients, but results have been mixed. METHODS: The study consists of a clinical trial comparing a new structured group intervention, called Cognitive-Behavioral Rehabilitation, with treatment as usual (TAU) for bipolar patients. The new approach is a combination of cognitive behavioral strategies and cognitive remediation exercises, consisting of 12 weekly group sessions of 90 min each. To be included in the study, patients must be diagnosed with BD type I or II, aged 18-55 years, in full or partial remission, and have an IQ of at least 80. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery, followed by mood, social functioning, and quality of life assessments will occur in three moments: pre and post intervention and 12 months later. The primary outcome of the study is to compare the time, in weeks, that the first full mood episode appears in patients who participated in either group of the study. Secondary outcome will include improvement in cognitive functions. DISCUSSION: This is the first controlled trial assessing the validity and effectiveness of the new Cognitive-Behavioral Rehabilitation intervention in preventing new mood episodes and improving cognitive and functional impairments.

In many cases, these symptoms seriously affect the social and psychological development of children and adolescents suffering from PBD. Complementary interventions, such as psychosocial and psychoeducational treatments, can help children and their families manage mood regulation and other challenges throughout childhood and adolescence. However, most research on such interventions has focused on children, single-family psychoeducation, and individual cognitive behavioural therapy. The present study, conducted in Sweden, used a case-series design to explore whether child- and family-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CFF-CBT) for PBD, adapted from children (8-12 years) to adolescents (13-18 years) and applied in a multi-family format, could help reduce symptoms, improve psychosocial functioning, increase parents' knowledge of and skills for coping with the disorder, and improve family expressed emotion for adolescents with PBD. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether the effects of such CFF-CBT are maintained at a one-year follow-up. Seven adolescents and 11 parents in two multi-family groups received twelve sessions of CFF-CBT. Self-rating questionnaires and clinical observations were used to evaluate clinically significant changes for individual cases. The results suggest that CFF-CBT is feasible to deliver in an outpatient psychiatric setting and may be effective for developing parents' skills and knowledge for coping with PBD, increasing adolescents' psychosocial functioning, and improving family climate. The results are in line with previous findings on CFF-CBT for children with PBD, suggesting that CFF-CBT is a valuable adjunctive treatment for adolescents with PBD. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Preliminary evidence indicates that CFF-CBT (RAINBOW) is both acceptable and an important complement to pharmacological treatment for adolescents suffering from paediatric bipolar disorder (PBD). Adolescent PBD populations show a high degree of comorbidity and individual clinical presentations that influence treatment results. Families show a large variation in ability to participate and benefit from RAINBOW treatment. Assessing and addressing pre-treatment environmental stressors and family climate during treatment is important for optimizing treatment effect. Symptoms of PBD fluctuate and new episodes can occur spontaneously. It is therefore important to follow PBD symptoms over time to draw more precise conclusions on treatment effects. When assessing treatment effects on psychiatric symptoms, social functioning, and family climate, it is important to use multiple rating sources, as ratings can vary considerably between adolescents, parents, and clinicians.",20160617,24,3,10.1002/cpp.2027,1099-0879

The combined use of ECT and anticonvulsant mood stabilizers is a common clinical scenario. There is dearth of systematic studies on the use of this combination with regard to clinical or cognitive outcomes. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to compare clinical improvement and cognitive adverse effects between patients who received only ECT versus those who received ECT and anticonvulsants. We hypothesized that improvement would be fastest in patients who received only ECT. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which patients prescribed ECT while being treated with anticonvulsants were randomized into 3 groups: full-dose (FD), half-dose (HD), and stop anticonvulsant. A blind rater assessed clinical improvement in patients using rating scales [Young's Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Clinical Global Impression] for clinical improvement and cognitive adverse effects (Postgraduate Institute memory scale). Analysis was done using mixed-effects modeling to delineate differences in clinical and cognitive outcomes across the 3 arms of the study over the course of ECT. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients recruited, 36 patients went into treatment allocation arms per the initial randomization plan. The main anticonvulsants prescribed were sodium valproate and carbamazepine. Patients in the 3 groups were comparable on clinical features. The most common diagnosis was bipolar affective disorder-with current episode of mania. Overall, there was no difference across the 3 groups in final clinical outcome scores (YMRS and Clinical Global Impression) when analyzed as intention to treat (ITT) or as treated. In both analyses, group × time interaction was significant when comparing trend of YMRS scores between the FD anticonvulsant group and the HD group from baseline to last ECT (P = 0.0435 in ITT and P = 0.0055 in as treated). Patients in the FD group improved faster than those in the HD group. There were no differences across the 3 groups with regard to their cognitive adverse effects in the ITT analysis; "as-treated analysis" showed the HD patients to have performed poorly on some domains. Seizure parameters showed no significant difference across the 3 groups. CONCLUSION: This is a preliminary prospective study examining whether coprescription of anticonvulsants with ECT affected clinical or cognitive outcomes. The most important takeaway point from this study is the significant reduction in YMRS scores when ECT was given with FD anticonvulsant compared with halving the dose (HD) of anticonvulsant. This difference was shown in both ITT and as-treated analysis. There is a need for more prospective studies to examine this clinical question.",20160927,33,1,10.1097/YCT.0000000000000357,1533-4112

The need for a more effective intervention prompted the development of a new cognitive behavioural therapy, based on an integrative cognitive model ('Think Effectively About Mood Swings' [TEAMS] therapy). Unlike previous interventions, TEAMS addresses current symptoms and comorbidities, and helps clients achieve long-term goals. A pilot randomized controlled trial (the TEAMS trial) of the therapy has recently concluded. This study explored participants' experiences of TEAMS, recommendations for improvement and experiences of useful changes post-therapy. Methods Fourteen TEAMS therapy participants took part in semi-structured interviews. Their accounts were analysed using interpretative thematic analysis. Two researchers coded the dataset independently. Member checks were conducted of the preliminary themes. Results Two overarching themes; 'useful elements of therapy' and 'changes from therapy' encompassed 12 emerging subthemes. Participants appreciated having opportunities to talk and described the therapy as person-centred and delivered by caring, approachable and skilled therapists. Some recommended more sessions than the 16 provided. Helpful therapeutic techniques were reported to be, normalization about moods, methods to increase understanding of moods, relapse-prevention, reappraisal techniques and metaphors. However, some did not find therapeutic techniques helpful. Post-therapy, many reported changes in managing mood swings more effectively and in their thinking (although some participants reported changes in neither). Many described increased acceptance of themselves and of having bipolar disorder, increased productivity and reduced anxiety in social situations.

This review was carried out to synthesize and evaluate relevant literature examining any cognitive impact of lithium in those with bipolar disorder. The effect of lithium in those with bipolar disorder was examined across the cognitive domains of attention, psychomotor speed, processing speed, working memory, intellectual functioning, verbal memory, visual memory, and executive functioning by reviewing the published empirical literature. Any impact of hypothyroidism and lithium toxicity was also examined. The literature supports the conclusion that lithium has a distinct impact on psychomotor speed in participants with bipolar disorder. In contrast, there appears to be no impact on attention. Any impact of lithium on memory in patients with bipolar disorder is unclear as the literature is contradictory and any such effect may be overshadowed by the greater impact of residual mood symptoms.

Novel treatment approaches that target clinical and cognitive aspects of bipolar depression are needed, and research on pathophysiology suggests that mitochondrial modulators such as the nutraceutical creatine monohydrate might have a therapeutic role for this condition. METHODS: Eighteen (N=18) patients with bipolar depression according to DSM-IV criteria who were enrollled in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of creatine monohydrate 6g daily as adjunctive therapy were submitted to neuropsychological assessments (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition, Stroop Color-Word Test, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test, FAS Verbal Fluency Test) at baseline and week 6. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups of the change on the total scores after 6 weeks in the verbal fluency test, with improvement in the group receiving adjunctive treatment with creatine. We did not find significant differences between the groups of the changes on other neuropsychological tests. LIMITATIONS: Small sample and lack of a control group of healthy subjects.

METHOD: We performed a person-level, pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials of maintenance varenicline, conducted in adult smokers with SBD and general population smokers, controlling for severity of dependence. Smokers abstinent after 12-weeks of open varenicline treatment were randomly assigned to &#8805;12-weeks maintenance varenicline or identical placebo. RESULTS: In those assigned to maintenance placebo, the abstinence rate at week-24 was lower in those with SBD than for those without psychiatric illness (29.4±1.1% vs. 61.8±0.4%, OR:0.26, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.52, p<0.001).

Effects of childhood trauma on working memory-related brain activation were examined in combined samples of clinical cases (independently of diagnosis) relative to HCs, as well as within each diagnostic category. Case-control analyses revealed increased activation of the left inferior parietal lobule as a main effect of trauma exposure. In addition, trauma exposure interacted with a diagnosis of SCZ or BD to reveal trauma-related increased activation in the cuneus in clinical cases and decreased activation in this region in controls. Disorder-specific functional alterations were also evident in the SCZ sample, but not BD. Childhood trauma exposure elicits aberrant function of parietal regions involved in working memory performance regardless of clinical status, as well as task-relevant visual regions that participates to attentional processes. Childhood trauma may therefore contribute to alterations in attention in SCZ and BD while performing an n-back working memory task.",20160420,11,3,10.1007/s11682-016-9548-z,1931-7565

In contrast, there is a paucity of research examining the therapeutic effects of exercise for those with bipolar disorder. Given that dysfunctional reward processing is central to bipolar disorder, research suggests that exercise can perhaps be framed as a reward-related event that may have the potential to precipitate a manic episode. The behavioural activation system (BAS) is a neurobehavioural system that is associated with responding to reward and provides an appropriate framework to theoretically examine and better understand the effects of exercise treatment on bipolar disorder. This article discusses recent research findings and provides an overview of the extant literature related to the neurobiological underpinnings of BAS and exercise as they relate to bipolar disorder. This is important clinically because depending on mood state in bipolar disorder, we postulate that exercise could be either beneficial or deleterious with positive or negative effects on the illness. Clearly, this complicates the evaluation of exercise as a potential treatment in terms of identifying its optimal characteristics in this population.",20160929,19,4,10.1136/eb-2016-102430,1468-960X

In the present study we investigated the 6-year cognitive and functional outcome of a sample of euthymic excellent lithium responders (ELR). METHOD: A total sample of twenty subjects was assessed at baseline and 6years later: ten diagnosed of bipolar disorder according to DSM-IV criteria and ten healthy matched controls. The sample size was enough to find statistical differences between groups, with a statistical power of 0.8. Bipolar patients were on lithium treatment during all this follow-up period and fulfilled ELR criteria as measured by the Alda scale. A neuropsychological test battery tapping into the main cognitive domains was used at baseline and at after 6-year of follow-up. Functional outcome was evaluated by means of the Functioning Assessment Short Test at study endpoint. RESULTS: Repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance showed that bipolar patients were cognitively impaired in the executive functioning, inhibition, processing speed and verbal memory domains (p<0.03) compared to controls and such deficits were stable over time.

METHOD: 38 patients with BP-I-D undergoing ECT at baseline were followed up two years later. A brief psychiatric and cognitive assessment (Mini Mental State Examination; short-term verbal memory test) was performed; patients completed questionnaires covering recurrence, treatment adherence, and mood (depression; hypomania). RESULTS: High cognitive performance at BL predicted high cognitive performance at FU; low mania scores at BL predicted low mania scores at FU.

This article describes the implementation and evaluation of group psychoeducational and cognitive behavioral treatment programs at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany, over the past 20 years. METHODS: Implementing psychoeducational programs was the first step to establish cognitive behavioral psychotherapy and dispel the myth of schizophrenia for patients. Programs are also provided for patients with mood disorders, substance use disorders, or both. These groups include topics such as psychoeducation about the illness, establishing rewarding activities, stress management, cognitive therapy, and relapse prevention. RESULTS: More than 1000 patients with schizophrenia or mood disorders (380 schizophrenia, 563 major depression, and 110 bipolar) have participated in illness management groups to learn about their illness and its treatment, and to learn skills to manage their illness. Patients have expressed satisfaction with the programs, and research has supported their effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with severe disorders can benefit from psychoeducational and cognitive treatment programs if the programs are adapted to the level of neuropsychological functioning and compensate for cognitive deficits and emotional overload.

METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, we recruited adults aged 18 years or older meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria for major depressive disorder from primary care and psychological therapy services in Devon, Durham, and Leeds (UK). We excluded people who were receiving psychological therapy, were alcohol or drug dependent, were acutely suicidal or had attempted suicide in the previous 2 months, or were cognitively impaired, or who had bipolar disorder or psychosis or psychotic symptoms. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) remotely using computer-generated allocation (minimisation used; stratified by depression severity [Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) score of <19 vs &#8805;19], antidepressant use, and recruitment site) to BA from junior mental health workers or CBT from psychological therapists. Randomisation done at the Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit was concealed from investigators. Treatment was given open label, but outcome assessors were masked. The primary outcome was depression symptoms according to the PHQ-9 at 12 months. We analysed all those who were randomly allocated and had complete data (modified intention to treat [mITT]) and also all those who were randomly allocated, had complete data, and received at least eight treatment sessions (per protocol [PP]). We analysed safety in the mITT population. The non-inferiority margin was 1·9 PHQ-9 points. This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN27473954. FINDINGS: Between Sept 26, 2012, and April 3, 2014, we randomly allocated 221 (50%) participants to BA and 219 (50%) to CBT. 175 (79%) participants were assessable for the primary outcome in the mITT population in the BA group compared with 189 (86%) in the CBT group, whereas 135 (61%) were assessable in the PP population in the BA group compared with 151 (69%) in the CBT group. BA was non-inferior to CBT (mITT: CBT 8·4 PHQ-9 points [SD 7·5], BA 8·4 PHQ-9 points [7·0], mean difference 0·1 PHQ-9 points [95% CI -1·3 to 1·5], p=0·89; PP: CBT 7·9 PHQ-9 points [7·3]; BA 7·8 [6·5], mean difference 0·0 PHQ-9 points [-1·5 to 1·6], p=0·99). Two (1%) non-trial-related deaths (one [1%] multidrug toxicity in the BA group and one [1%] cancer in the CBT group) and 15 depression-related, but not treatment-related, serious adverse events (three in the BA group and 12 in the CBT group) occurred in three [2%] participants in the BA group (two [1%] patients who overdosed and one [1%] who self-harmed) and eight (4%) participants in the CBT group (seven [4%] who overdosed and one [1%] who self-harmed). INTERPRETATION: We found that BA, a simpler psychological treatment than CBT, can be delivered by junior mental health workers with less intensive and costly training, with no lesser effect than CBT. Effective psychological therapy for depression can be delivered without the need for costly and highly trained professionals.

METHODS: Eighty-five patients with BD were randomized to receive 10 weekly sessions of GP followed by 8 booster-sessions over the next two years, or three sessions of IP. Time to first admission over the course of GP was the primary outcome measure, with additional outcomes examining the use of psychiatric services over about 8 years. RESULTS: Patients allocated to GP had longer survival time compared to IP over 27 months (p<0.05). There were also group differences in survival time over 8 years, but treatment allocation alone was no longer a significant predictor of survival time (p=0.07). There was an interaction between group (GP/IP) and harmful substance use (HSU), such that GP cases with comorbid HSU had the shortest survival time, whilst GP cases without HSU survived the longest (p=0.02). Also, GP cases had a small but significant reduction in hospital use compared with IP (p=0.04). LIMITATIONS: We did not have a 'pure' treatment as usual group.

To address this gap, researchers have developed adjunctive psychotherapies. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the evidence for the efficacy of manualized psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder. METHODS: We conducted a search of the literature to examine recent (2007-present), randomized controlled studies of the following psychotherapy interventions for bipolar disorder: psychoeducation (PE), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), and family therapies such as family focused therapy (FFT). RESULTS: All of the psychotherapy interventions appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. Psychoeducation and CBT are associated with increased time to mood episode relapse or recurrence. MBCT has demonstrated a particular effectiveness in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms. Online psychotherapy interventions, programs combining one or more psychotherapy interventions, and targeted interventions centering on particular symptoms have been the focus of recent, randomized controlled studies in bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotherapy interventions for the treatment of bipolar disorder have substantial evidence for efficacy.

The goal of this study was to modify BA for the adjunctive treatment of bipolar depression and to pilot it in a proof of concept trial to assess its preliminary feasibility and acceptability for this population. METHODS: Twelve adults with bipolar depression were recruited from hospital settings and enrolled in a 20-week open trial of the modified BA, delivered in 16 outpatient sessions, as an adjunct to community pharmacotherapy for bipolar disorder. Symptom severity was assessed at pretreatment and posttreatment by an independent evaluator. Patient satisfaction was also assessed posttreatment. RESULTS: Feasibility and acceptability were high, with 10 of 12 patients completing treatment, an average of 14.8 (SD=5.2) of 16 sessions attended, and high levels of self-reported treatment satisfaction. Patients exhibited statistically significant improvement from pretreatment to posttreatment on measures of depressive symptoms, manic symptoms, and severity of suicidal ideation.

Therefore, we conducted a comparative clinical trial evaluating clinical responses to prefrontal bilateral and unilateral rTMS in patients suffering from bipolar depression. We hypothesized that, 1) the response to the treatment would be associated with a decrease in the frequency of beta waves, 2) bilateral stimulation of the cortex would bring about more extensive changes in brain activity than unilateral stimulation, and 3) bilateral stimulation is more effective than unilateral. Thirty patients with bipolar depression were divided into two groups. Bilateral Group (n=15) who received rTMS in the left DLPFC (10Hz) and right DLPFC (1-Hz), and unilateral group (n=15) who received the stimulation only in the right DLPFC (1-Hz) during 20 treatment sessions. The proportion of responders in the bilateral stimulation group was significantly higher than that in the unilateral group [80% versus 47%]. The remission rate was 40% in the bilateral group and 40% in the unilateral group (not significant). In the responders to bilateral rTMS treatment, a significant reduction of alpha1-2, beta 1-3, and gamma frequencies were observed in medial and superior frontal and cingulate gyrus . Responders to the unilateral treatment showed decrease of gamma frequency in postcentral gyrus, precuneus, superior and inferior parietal lobule, Cuneus and angular gyrus.

A total of 103 participants who attempted suicide or died by suicide during the trial were included; a 15% random sample of the remaining participants (n = 427) was used as a comparison sample. Linear mixed models in the six months before suicidal behavior were conducted for each of five proposed acute risk factors for suicidal behavior. Participants were assessed using the Clinical Monitoring Form (CMF) at each visit for the following potential acute risk factors for suicidal behavior: suicidal ideation, loss of interest, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, and high-risk behavior. RESULTS: Each of the five symptoms was elevated overall in individuals who engaged in suicidal behavior (p < 0.05). The severity of both suicidal ideation and loss of interest significantly increased in the months before suicidal behavior (p < 0.001).

Aside from the economic advantages, maximizing SWB confers obvious individual and clinical benefits for people with severe mental illness, such as psychosis. Gaining a better understanding of well-being and its determinants will enable current evidence-based interventions to be targeted and refined appropriately. This study therefore sought to identify the cross-sectional correlates of SWB in an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies for people with Severe Mental Illness psychosis demonstration site, to inform a future longitudinal investigation. METHODS: Participants with a psychosis or bipolar spectrum diagnosis referred to the demonstration site (n = 410) rated SWB as part of their initial assessment before starting psychological therapy. Potential influencing factors including age, gender, ethnicity, employment status, illness duration, perceived social support, perceived coping, and psychotic symptoms (voices and beliefs) were also assessed. RESULTS: Regression analyses showed that unemployment (ß = -.16, p < .001), lack of social support (ß = -.20, p < .001), distressing beliefs (ß = -.12, p = .004), and poorer coping (ß = -.43, p < .001) were associated with reduced SWB, together accounting for 43% of the variance in well-being, F(5, 392) = 58.42, p < .001; mean SWB = 39.09, SD = 11.61. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary insights into the determinants of SWB in a large sample of people with psychosis. Improving employability, social interactions, coping strategies, and psychotic symptoms may improve SWB. Further longitudinal investigation will determine the potential value of preferentially targeting these areas in therapy to meet national requirements to prioritize well-being outcomes. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Average well-being in people with psychosis was lower than SWB previously reported for the general population. Unemployment, lack of social support, poorer coping, and distressing beliefs were all associated with lower levels of well-being in people with psychosis. Psychological interventions targeting the positive symptoms of psychosis may impact on well-being. Greater focus on promoting social contact and inclusion and facilitating a return to employment may further improve well-being outcomes following psychological intervention. The cross-sectional design of the study does not allow for firm conclusions about the causal relationship between well-being and associated factors in psychosis. The study was carried out within a particular service context, and the findings need replicating before they can be considered to be generalizable outside this setting.",20160430,55,4,10.1111/bjc.12112,0144-6657

Also linked to cognitive deficits associated with SGA-treatment are catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene variants. In this study, we examine the relationship between cognition in SGA use and COMT rs5993883 in cohort sample of subjects with BD. METHODS: Interactions between SGA-treatment and COMT rs5993883 genotype on cognition was tested using a battery of neuropsychological tests performed in cross-sectional study of 246 bipolar subjects. RESULTS: The mean age of our sample was 40.15 years and was comprised of 70 % female subjects. Significant demographic differences included gender, hospitalizations, benzodiazepine/antidepressant use and BD-type diagnosis. Linear regressions showed that the COMT rs5993883 GG genotype predicted lower verbal learning (p = 0.0006) and memory (p = 0.0026) scores, and lower scores on a cognitive control task (p = 0.004) in SGA-treated subjects.

METHODS: Key words pertaining to neurocognition in bipolar disorder and lithium treatment were used to search recognized databases to identify relevant literature. The authors also retrieved gray literature (e.g., book chapters) known to them and examined pertinent articles from bibliographies. RESULTS: A limited number of studies have examined the effects of lithium on neurocognition in bipolar disorder and, although in some domains a consistent picture emerges, in many domains the findings are mixed. Lithium administration appears to reshape key components of neurocognition - in particular, psychomotor speed, verbal memory, and verbal fluency. Notably, it has a sophisticated neurocognitive profile, such that while lithium impairs neurocognition across some domains, it seemingly preserves others - possibly those vulnerable to the effects of bipolar disorder. Furthermore, its effects are likely to be direct and indirect (via mood, for example) and cumulative with duration of treatment. Disentangling the components of neurocognition modulated by lithium in the context of a fluctuating and complex illness such as bipolar disorder is a significant challenge but one that therefore demands a stratified and systematic approach, such as that provided by the Lithium Battery. CONCLUSIONS: In order to delineate the effects of lithium therapy on neurocognition in bipolar disorder within both research and clinical practice, a greater understanding and measurement of the relatively stable neurocognitive components is needed to examine those that indeed change with lithium treatment. In order to achieve this, we propose a Lithium Battery-Clinical and a Lithium Battery-Research that can be applied to these respective settings.",20160324,18,2,10.1111/bdi.12375,1399-5618

The number of people living with this condition is set to rise as the UK experiences a rapid ageing of its population. To date, there has been very little research or service development with respect to psychological therapies for this group of people. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A parallel two-arm randomised controlled trial comparing a 14-session, 6-month Recovery-focused Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for Older Adults with bipolar disorder (RfCBT-OA) plus treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU alone. Participants will be recruited in the North-West of England via primary and secondary mental health services and through self-referral. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of RfCBT-OA; therefore, a formal power calculation is not appropriate. It has been estimated that randomising 25 participants per group will be sufficient to be able to reliably determine the primary feasibility outcomes (eg, recruitment and retention rates), in line with recommendations for sample sizes for feasibility/pilot trials. Participants in both arms will complete assessments at baseline and then every 3 months, over the 12-month follow-up period. We will gain an estimate of the likely effect size of RfCBT-OA on a range of clinical outcomes and estimate parameters needed to determine the appropriate sample size for a definitive, larger trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RfCBT-OA. Data analysis is discussed further in the Analysis section in the main paper. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was approved by the UK National Health Service (NHS) Ethics Committee process (REC ref: 15/NW/0330). The findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conference presentations and local, participating NHS trusts.

Outcomes were meta-analysed using RevMan and confidence assessed using the GRADE method. RESULTS: We included 55 trials with 6010 participants. Moderate-quality evidence associated individual psychological interventions with reduced relapses at post-treatment (risk ratio (RR) = 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.92) and follow-up (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.87), and collaborative care with a reduction in hospital admissions (RR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.49-0.94). Low-quality evidence associated group interventions with fewer depression relapses at post-treatment and follow-up, and family psychoeducation with reduced symptoms of depression and mania.

Computer-based cognitive remediation has shown promise in improving cognition in patients with schizophrenia. However, despite similar neurocognitive deficits between patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, few studies have extended neuroscience-based cognitive remediation programs to this population. METHODS/DESIGN: The Treatment to Enhance Cognition in Bipolar Disorder study is an investigator-initiated, parallel group, randomized, blinded clinical trial of an Internet-based cognitive remediation protocol for patients with bipolar disorder I with psychosis (n = 100). We also describe the development of our dose-matched active control paradigm. Both conditions involve 70 sessions of computer-based activities over 24 weeks. The control intervention was developed to mirror the treatment condition in dose and format but without the neuroplasticity-based task design and structure. All participants undergo neuropsychological and clinical assessment at baseline, after approximately 25 hours of study activities, post treatment, and after 6 months of no study contact to assess durability. Neuroimaging at baseline and post treatment are offered in an opt-in format. The primary outcomes are scores on the MATRICS battery; secondary and exploratory outcomes include measures of clinical symptoms, community functioning, and neuroimaging changes. Associations between change in cognitive measures and change in community functioning will be assessed. Baseline predictors of treatment response will be examined. DISCUSSION: The present study is the first we are aware of to implement an Internet-based cognitive remediation program in patients with bipolar disorder with psychosis and to develop a comparable web-based control paradigm. The mixed online and study-site format allows accessible treatment while providing weekly staff contact and bridging. Based on user-provided feedback, participant blinding is feasible.

Its aim is to identify early clinical, neurocognitive and biological effects. Participants (n = 40) will undergo an intensive battery of multi-modal investigations, including remote monitoring of mood, activity and physiology, as well as cognitive testing, fMRI and magnetoencephalography, together with biochemical and gene expression measurements to assess renal, inflammatory and circadian effects. DISCUSSION: The findings derived from this trial may be of value in predicting subsequent therapeutic response or side effects, not only relevant to the use of lithium but also providing a potential signature to help in more rapid evaluation of novel mood stabilisers.

METHODS: A total of 202 FT patients with BD-I (n = 101) and SCZ spectrum disorder (n = 101), in addition to HCs (n = 101), were included. A comprehensive neurocognitive test battery was used to assess verbal learning and memory, executive functioning, processing speed, and attention and working memory. Neurocognitive functioning and the effect of history of psychosis and number of previous episodes were analyzed using separate multivariate analyses of variance and correlation analysis. RESULTS: FT patients with BD-I performed intermediately between FT SCZ spectrum patients and HCs on all measures. Compared to HCs, FT BD-I showed impaired functioning across all neurocognitive domains. No differences in neurocognitive functioning were observed in psychotic versus nonpsychotic FT patients with BD-I. With the exception of an association between number of manic episodes and two measures of executive function in FT BD-I, no associations were found between number of episodes and neurocognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive impairments were present in FT BD-I, and were not explained by history of psychosis or number of previous psychotic or depressive episodes. There were indications that executive function could be associated with number of previous manic episodes.",20160319,18,2,10.1111/bdi.12377,1399-5618

To examine this hypothesis, affective temperament was compared between MDD-DT, easy-to-treat major depressive disorder (MDD-ET), and bipolar disorder. METHODS: Affective temperament was measured in 320 patients (69, 56, and 195 with MDD-ET, MDD-DT, and bipolar disorder, respectively) using the self-rated questionnaire version of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego (TEMPS-A), with between-group differences examined using multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for confounders. Optimal cut-off points for TEMPS-A scores to discriminate between diagnostic groups were determined using receiver-operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Of the five temperamental domains, the mode for cyclothymic temperament score was highest, followed by those of bipolar disorder, MDD-DT, and MDD-ET. The cyclothymic temperament score discriminated significantly between bipolar disorder and MDD-DT (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.20, p=0.0022), MDD-DT and MDD-ET (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.31, p=0.0334), and bipolar and major depressive disorders (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.07-1.28, p=0.0003). Optimal cut-off points for the cyclothymic temperament scores to discriminate between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder and MDD-DT and MDD-ET were 9 (sensitivity: 64.6%, specificity: 76.0%) and 6 (66.1%, 62.3%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MDD-DT has a quantitatively stronger bipolar temperamental feature, cyclothymic temperament, relative to that of MDD-ET.

METHOD: Outpatients with bipolar illness diagnosed by SCID were rated by research assistants on the NIMH-LCM and those who had an good response for at least 6months (much or very much improved on the CGI-BP) were considered responders (treatment success). Clinical characteristics associated with treatment response in the literature were examined for how often a drug was in a successful regimen when a given characteristic was either present or absent. RESULTS: Lithium was less successful in those with histories of rapid cycling, substance abuse, or (surprisingly) a positive parental history of mood disorders. Valproate was less successful in those with &#8805;20 prior episodes. Lamotrigine (LTG) was less successful in those with a parental history of mood disorders or in BP-I compared to BP-II disorder. Antidepressants (ADs) had low success rates, especially in those with a history of anxiety disorders.

RECENT FINDINGS: Although the majority of studies evaluating psychiatric comorbidity in migraine have focused on depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders are highly associated with migraine and relevant for prognosis and treatment planning. Comorbid psychiatric disorders may be associated with poorer treatment response for some acute pharmacotherapies; however, people with comorbid migraine and mood or anxiety disorders can achieve large responses to preventive pharmacologic and behavioral therapies. Emerging research is developing and evaluating behavioral treatments designed to manage cooccurring migraine and mood or anxiety disorders. Stigma related to psychiatric disorders has been well characterized, and could exacerbate extant migraine-related stigma. SUMMARY: Anxiety and mood disorders are prevalent in people with migraine, although not ubiquitous. Psychiatric comorbidity is associated with greater migraine symptoms and disability; however, people with comorbid depression or anxiety are amenable to preventive migraine treatment.

Moreover, low compliance in patients with bipolar disorder is one of the main reasons for relapse. This in turn, is associated with an increase in neurocognitive symptoms. The current study aimed to determine whether attention, memory, and executive function are related to the level of compliance to pharmacological treatment in individuals with bipolar disorder in euthymic phase. METHOD: We examined 34 patients with bipolar disorder (12 with low compliance to the treatment and 22 with high compliance to the treatment) according to the DSM-IV criteria, in the range of 18-55 years. All patients were assessed through a neuropsychological battery in one single session. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare neuropsychological test scores between low and high compliance patients. Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were included as covariates in the study. RESULTS: Patients with low level of compliance performed significantly worse than high treatment compliance on verbal memory immediate free recall (F (1)=12.14, p=.002), verbal memory immediate cued recall (F (1)=10.45, p=.003), verbal memory delayed free recall (F (1)=5.52, p=.027), and verbal memory delayed cued recall (F (1)=6.11, p=.021). Covariates such as number of manic episodes, history of psychosis and years of education were found significant for executive functions and processing speed. CONCLUSION: We found that low compliance to pharmacological treatment is consistently linked to immediate and delayed verbal memory. In addition, executive function and processing speed were associated with clinical and demographic characteristics.

This mini-review draws on two separate systematic searches to identify possible interventions for comorbid problem gambling and psychiatric disorders, highlight the gaps in the currently available evidence base, and stimulate further research in this area. In this mini-review, only 21 studies that have conducted post-hoc analyses to explore the influence of psychiatric disorders or problem gambling subtypes on gambling outcomes from different types of treatment were identified. The findings of these studies suggest that most gambling treatments are not contraindicated by psychiatric disorders. Moreover, only 6 randomized studies comparing the efficacy of interventions targeted towards specific comorbidity subgroups with a control/comparison group were identified. The results of these studies provide preliminary evidence for modified dialectical behavior therapy for comorbid substance use, the addition of naltrexone to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for comorbid alcohol use problems, and the addition of N-acetylcysteine to tobacco support programs and imaginal desensitisation/motivational interviewing for comorbid nicotine dependence. They also suggest that lithium for comorbid bipolar disorder, escitalopram for comorbid anxiety disorders, and the addition of CBT to standard drug treatment for comorbid schizophrenia may be effective. Future research evaluating interventions sequenced according to disorder severity or the functional relationship between the gambling behavior and comorbid symptomatology, identifying psychiatric disorders as moderators of the efficacy of problem gambling interventions, and evaluating interventions matched to client comorbidity could advance this immature field of study.",20160223,58,,10.1016/j.addbeh.2016.02.012,1873-6327

Furthermore, identifying neuroimaging biomarkers related to dimensional measures of behavior may provide targets to guide individualized treatment. We aimed to use functional neuroimaging and pattern regression techniques to determine whether patterns of brain activity could accurately decode individual-level severity on a dimensional scale measuring behavioural and emotional dysregulation at two different time points. METHODS: A sample of fifty-seven youth (mean age: 14.5 years; 32 males) was selected from a multi-site study of youth with parent-reported behavioral and emotional dysregulation. Participants performed a block-design reward paradigm during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Pattern regression analyses consisted of Relevance Vector Regression (RVR) and two cross-validation strategies implemented in the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging toolbox (PRoNTo). Medication was treated as a binary confounding variable. Decoded and actual clinical scores were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate the models. Permutation test was applied to estimate significance levels. RESULTS: Relevance Vector Regression identified patterns of neural activity associated with symptoms of behavioral and emotional dysregulation at the initial study screen and close to the fMRI scanning session. The correlation and the mean squared error between actual and decoded symptoms were significant at the initial study screen and close to the fMRI scanning session. However, after controlling for potential medication effects, results remained significant only for decoding symptoms at the initial study screen. Neural regions with the highest contribution to the pattern regression model included cerebellum, sensory-motor and fronto-limbic areas. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of pattern regression models and neuroimaging can help to determine the severity of behavioral and emotional dysregulation in youth at different time points.",20160106,11,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0117603,1932-6203

Mood swings persist during remission from acute mood episodes and impair daily functioning. The last significant treatment advance remains Lithium (in the 1970s), which aids only the minority of patients. There is no accepted way to establish proof of concept for a new mood-stabilizing treatment. We suggest that combining insights from mood measurement with applied mathematics may provide a step change: repeated daily mood measurement (depression) over a short time frame (1 month) can create individual bipolar mood instability profiles. A time-series approach allows comparison of mood instability pre- and post-treatment. We test a new imagery-focused cognitive therapy treatment approach (MAPP; Mood Action Psychology Programme) targeting a driver of mood instability, and apply these measurement methods in a non-concurrent multiple baseline design case series of 14 patients with bipolar disorder. Weekly mood monitoring and treatment target data improved for the whole sample combined. Time-series analyses of daily mood data, sampled remotely (mobile phone/Internet) for 28 days pre- and post-treatment, demonstrated improvements in individuals' mood stability for 11 of 14 patients. Thus the findings offer preliminary support for a new imagery-focused treatment approach. They also indicate a step in treatment innovation without the requirement for trials in illness episodes or relapse prevention. Importantly, daily measurement offers a description of mood instability at the individual patient level in a clinically meaningful time frame. This costly, chronic and disabling mental illness demands innovation in both treatment approaches (whether pharmacological or psychological) and measurement tool: this work indicates that daily measurements can be used to detect improvement in individual mood stability for treatment innovation (MAPP).",20160127,6,,10.1038/tp.2015.207,2158-3188

However, there have only been few attempts to investigate the effects of functional remediation for patients with bipolar disorder. The current study investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of a combined group and individual functional remediation program for bipolar disorder, including both patients and their caregivers. METHODS: Twelve participants diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, and their caregivers, were treated with a combined group and individual functional remediation program. The feasibility of the program was evaluated by dropout rates and participants' evaluations of the program. The effectiveness of the program was explored through the assessment of functional outcome at baseline, immediately post-treatment, and follow-up three months later. RESULTS: The results indicate a high degree of satisfaction and a low dropout rate with the current program. Assessment of outcomes suggests improved functioning in the areas of autonomy and occupational functioning, evolving from baseline to follow-up. LIMITATIONS: Due to a small sample size and the lack of a control group the results are preliminary.

METHOD: Three groups of BD patients were established according to their treatment: (i) lithium monotherapy (n=29); (ii) lithium together with one or more anticonvulsants (n=28); and (iii) one or more anticonvulsants (n=16). A group of healthy controls served as the control (n=25). The following tests were applied: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Trail Making Test, Wechsler Memory Scale, Rey Complex Figure Test, Stroop color-word test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Tower of Hanoi, Frontal Assessment Battery, and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. RESULTS: Relative to healthy controls, BD patients showed the following: (i) those on lithium monotherapy, but not other BD groups, had preserved short-term auditory memory, long-term memory, and attention; (ii) those who took only anticonvulsants showed worse findings in short-term visual memory, working memory, and several executive functions; and (iii) all BD patients showed worse performance in processing speed, resistance to interference, and emotion recognition. LIMITATIONS: Medication alone cannot explain why all BD patients showed common cognitive deficits despite different pharmacological treatment. CONCLUSION: The impairment on some executive functions and emotion recognition is an inherent trait in BD patients, regardless of their pharmacological treatment. However, while memory, attention, and most of the executive functions are preserved in long-term stable BD patients, these cognitive functions are impaired in those who take anticonvulsants.",20151020,190,,10.1016/j.jad.2015.10.008,1573-2517

However, antidepressant medications commonly used to treat symptoms of anxiety may accelerate the onset of mania in these already at-risk youth. Therefore, studies evaluating innovative non-pharmacologic treatments for anxiety in this population are urgently needed. METHODS: Subjects participated in 12 weekly sessions of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for children (MBCT-C), a manualized group psychotherapeutic intervention utilizing cognitive behavioural principles and mindfulness exercises to increase regulation of attention and non-judgmental acceptance of present moment thoughts, emotions and experiences. Independent raters administered symptoms rating scales prior to each treatment session. Spearman correlations and paired-samples signed rank tests were used to examine outcomes. After-intervention surveys and session transcripts were reviewed to assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. RESULTS: Participants included 10 youth (meanage  = 13.2; 80% girls; 40% biracial) with generalized, social and/or separation anxiety disorders, and a parent with bipolar disorder. Clinician-rated anxiety was significantly reduced after intervention (meanbefore  = 11.1; meanafter  = 4.3; P < 0.01), as well as youth-rated trait anxiety (P = 0.03).

Little is known about the pathway by which these appraisals and behaviours interact in the formation of activated and depressed affective states. This study tested the predictions that (1) ascent behaviours mediate the relationship between positive appraisals of activated mood and activation; and (2) descent behaviours mediate the relationship between negative appraisals of activated mood and depression. METHOD: A total of 52 individuals with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder (confirmed by structured interview) completed biweekly assessments of affect regulation behaviours and mood for 4 weeks. Positive and negative appraisals of affective states were assessed at baseline through the Hypomanic Attitudes and Positive Prediction Inventory. Multilevel mediation analysis was used to explore the data. RESULTS: Ascent behaviours partially mediated the relationship between positive appraisals of activated mood and activation. Descent behaviours, but not negative appraisals of activated mood, predicted levels of depression indicating the absence of a mediation effect. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that positive appraisals of activated mood can escalate activation in individuals with bipolar disorder. Such appraisals may be inherently rewarding and reinforcing directly elevating levels of activation, whilst increasing individuals' use of ascent behaviours. The results are consistent with the view that appraisals and behaviours should be targeted during cognitive behavioural therapy for bipolar disorder. PRACTITIONER POINTS: It may be beneficial to target positive appraisals of activated mood in cognitive behavioural therapy for mania. Cognitive behavioural therapists may also wish to focus on identifying and targeting individuals' use of ascent behaviours to reduce highly activated states.",20150331,55,3,10.1111/bjc.12081,0144-6657

METHOD: Data was collected from case notes in three centers. There were 133 in total, grouped as RUL-UB (50), BT (43), BF (23), RUL-B (17). Two of the three centers had a preferred electrode placement and pulse width. RESULTS: Apart from age, the groups did not differ significantly on sex distribution, proportion of bipolar depression and psychotic symptoms. 56% of patients in RUL-UB switched compared to 12.5% in RUL-B, 4.9% in BT and none in BF (p value < 0.0001). When we considered patients who switched as treatment failures, remission rates were significantly different (p value < 0.0001) 40% in RUL-UB, 81.3% in RUL-B, 73.9% in BF and 78.0% in BT. Mean number of treatments in each group was significantly different (p value < 0.0001); 12.02 in RUL-UB, 10.2 in RUL-B, 7 in BF and 7.5 in BT. Post-hoc analysis indicated that RUL-UB differed significantly from BT and BF. Final response and remission rates including patients who switched were 98% and 82% in RUL-UB, 100% and 93.8% in RUL-B, 100% and 73.9% in BF and 97.7% and 83.7% in BT.

Peer-reviewed studies were identified using 4 major research databases. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies testing interventions to address medical conditions and risk behaviors among persons with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder between January 2000 and June 2014 were included. Information was abstracted from each study by 2 trained reviewers, who also rated study quality using a standard tool. Following individual study review, the quality of the evidence (high, medium, low) and the effectiveness of various interventions were synthesized. 108 studies were included. The majority of studies examined interventions to address overweight/obesity (n = 80). The strength of the evidence was high for 4 interventions: metformin and behavioral interventions had beneficial effects on weight loss; and bupropion and varenicline reduced tobacco smoking. The strength of the evidence was low for most other interventions reviewed. Future studies should test long-term interventions to cardiovascular risk factors and health-risk behaviors.

However, its primary effects on cognition remain ambiguous. We sought to investigate the profile of cognitive impairment in patients with bipolar disorder and to determine whether continued treatment with lithium preserves cognitive functioning. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we tested 15 euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder undergoing long-term clinical maintenance treatment with lithium (for at least 12 months), 15 matched patients treated with other mood-stabilizing drugs and who had never received lithium, and 15 matched healthy subjects on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Investigated cognitive domains were visual memory, executive functions, attention, decision-making/impulsivity, and response inhibition. We controlled for age, gender, intelligence, and residual psychiatric symptomatology. RESULTS: Taken together, bipolar patients demonstrated robust deficits in visual memory and executive functions. Once subdivided in treatment subgroups, only non-lithium bipolar patients demonstrated impairments in visual memory. Attention, decision-making, and response inhibition were preserved in both groups. No correlation emerged between neuropsychological tests performance, clinical, and psychological variables. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to our knowledge to have demonstrated, by means of a highly sensitive test of visual memory, a potential hippocampus neuroprotective effect of lithium in patients with bipolar disorder.

This finding has prompted studies to investigate cognitive enhancement programs as potential treatments for BD, primarily focusing on cognitive reinforcement and daily functioning and not restricted to psychoeducation and coping strategies, unlike traditional psychosocial treatments. Objective: This study presents a systematic review of controlled trials of cognitive rehabilitation (CR) for BD. Our main objective is to describe the results of studies of rehabilitation programs for BD and related methodological issues. Method: Electronic database searches (MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase) were conducted to identify articles using terms related to BD and CR. The methodological quality of each article was measured using the 5-item Jadad scale. Results: A total of 239 articles were initially identified, but after application of exclusion criteria, only four were retained for this review. An average of 17 hours of intervention sessions were conducted, distributed as 0.95 hours per week and three of the four studies reported better executive function performance after CR interventions. Conclusions: We did not find robust evidence to support cognitive rehabilitation as an effective treatment for BD, because of: 1) the variety of intervention designs; 2) the methodological limitations of the studies; and 3) the lack of studies in the field.",20160121,37,4,10.1590/2237-6089-2015-0006,2237-6089

It was also compared to a Neuropsychological battery measuring the same scale domains. The correlation between each one of the sub-tests of the scale and stability was evaluated through the reliability test-retest in the group with bipolar disorder I. RESULTS: The scale showed discriminatory capacity in cognitive functioning between the control group and the group with bipolar disorder I.

We use an MRI-based Gradient Echo Plural Contrast Imaging (GEPCI) technique that produces inherently co-registered images allowing quantitative assessment of tissue cellular and hemodynamic properties. Usually described as R2* (=1/T2*) relaxation rate constant, recent developments in GEPCI allow the separation of cellular-specific (R2*C) and hemodynamic (BOLD) contributions to the MRI signal decay. We characterize BOLD effect in terms of tissue concentration of deoxyhemoglobin, i.e. CDEOXY, which reflects brain activity. 17 control (CON), 17 bipolar disorder (BPD), 16 schizophrenia (SCZ), and 12 unaffected schizophrenia sibling (SIB) participants were scanned and post-processed using GEPCI protocols. A MANOVA of 38gray matter regions ROIs showed significant group effects for CDEOXY but not for R2*C. In the three non-control groups, 71-92% of brain regions had increased CDEOXY. Group effects were observed in the superior temporal cortex and the thalamus. Increased superior temporal cortex CDEOXY was found in SCZ (p=0.01), BPD (p=0.01) and SIB (p=0.02), with bilateral effects in SCZ and only left hemisphere effects in BPD and SIB. Thalamic CDEOXY abnormalities were observed in SCZ (p=0.003), BPD (p=0.03) and SIB (p=0.02). Our results suggest that increased activity in certain brain regions is part of the underlying pathophysiology of specific psychiatric disorders.

The impact engagement with these discussion boards has on the psychosocial well-being of users is largely unknown. More specifically we need to clarify the influence of the type and level of engagement on outcomes. The primary aim of this exploratory study is to determine if there is a relationship between different types (active, passive or none) and levels (high, mid and low) of discussion board engagement and improvement in outcome measures from baseline to follow up, with a focus on self-reported social support, stigma, quality of life and levels of depression and mania. The secondary aim of this study is to identify any differences in demographic variables among discussion users. METHODS/DESIGN: The present study is a sub-study of the MoodSwings 2.0 3-arm randomised controlled trial (discussion board only (arm 1), discussion board plus psychoeducation (arm 2), discussion board, psychoeducation plus cognitive behavioural therapy-based tools (arm 3)). Discussion engagement will be measured via online participant activity monitoring. Assessments include online self-report as well as blinded phone interviews at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow up. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will help to inform future programs about whether or not discussion boards are a beneficial inclusion in online self-help interventions. It will also help to determine if motivating users to actively engage in online discussion is necessary, and if so, what level of engagement is optimal to produce the most benefit. Future programs may benefit through being able to identify those most likely to poorly engage, based on demographic variables, so motivational strategies can be targeted accordingly.

Several cognitive endophenotypes, such as executive functions and verbal memory, have been suggested. A key component of executive functioning is inhibition, a complex construct consisting of various subtypes. Only some of these subtypes have been investigated in BD participants and their relatives. Recent findings suggest that difficulties with more basic functions such as processing speed may account for some of the deficits observed in BD. This possibility has not been explored for inhibitory functions. METHOD: The current study investigated interference, behavioral and cognitive inhibition, and set-shifting in 36 BD participants, 24 of their unaffected first-degree relatives, and 40 healthy controls. We first used analysis of variance to assess group differences. This was followed by a second analysis in which we controlled for age and processing speed. RESULTS: Group performances after adjustment for age and processing speed were similar in tasks assessing interference and inhibition. However, shifting to a different task set required more time in BD participants than in controls even after adjustment for age and processing speed. BD relatives appeared to show a similar slowing but findings did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that responses to interference and inhibitory functions may be preserved in BD participants; however, set-shifting abilities appear to be impaired in BD participants and may be affected in their relatives. Our findings further underline the importance of adjusting for more basic functions such as processing speed when evaluating neuropsychological functions.",20150905,37,10,10.1080/13803395.2015.1081157,1744-411X

Molecular imaging, in particular PET, has allowed for elucidation of the essential contribution of the serotonin transporter to the pathophysiology of various psychiatric disorders and their treatment. We review studies that use PET to measure cerebral serotonin transporter activity in psychiatric disorders, focusing on major depressive disorder and antidepressant treatment. We also discuss opportunities and limitations in the application of this neuroimaging method in clinical practice. Although results from individual studies diverge, meta-analysis indicates a trend towards reduced serotonin transporter availability in patients with major depressive disorder. Inconsistencies in results might suggest symptom heterogeneity in major depressive disorder and might therefore be relevant for stratification of patients into clinical subsets. PET has enabled the elucidation of mechanisms of response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and hence provides a basis for rational pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorder. Such imaging studies have also suggested that the pattern of serotonin transporter binding before treatment might predict response to antidepressant treatment, which could potentially be clinically useful in the future. Additionally, this Review discusses PET studies investigating the serotonin transporter in anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders. Few studies have shown changes in serotonin transporter activity in schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. By showing the scarcity of data in these psychiatric disorders, we highlight the potential for further investigation in this field.",20150808,2,8,10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00232-1,2215-0374

Cannabis dependence is a recognised psychiatric diagnosis, often diagnosed via the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of medical and psychological problems. This systematic review evaluates the use of a wide variety of psychological and psychosocial interventions, such as motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and contingency management. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the clinical effectiveness of psychological and psychosocial interventions for cannabis cessation in adults who use cannabis regularly. DATA SOURCES: Studies were identified via searches of 11 databases [MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, PsycINFO, Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index, ClinicalTrials.gov and metaRegister of Current Controlled Trials] from inception to February 2014, searching of existing reviews and reference tracking. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing psychological or psychosocial interventions in a community setting were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed using adapted Cochrane criteria and narrative synthesis was undertaken. Outcomes included change in cannabis use, severity of cannabis dependence, motivation to change and intervention adherence. RESULTS: The review included 33 RCTs conducted in various countries (mostly the USA and Australia). General population studies: 26 studies assessed the general population of cannabis users. Across six studies, CBT (4-14 sessions) significantly improved outcomes (cannabis use, severity of dependence, cannabis problems) compared with wait list post treatment, maintained at 9 months in the one study with later follow-up. Studies of briefer MI or motivational enhancement therapy (MET) (one or two sessions) gave mixed results, with some improvements over wait list, while some comparisons were not significant. Four studies comparing CBT (6-14 sessions) with MI/MET (1-4 sessions) also gave mixed results: longer courses of CBT provided some improvements over MI. In one small study, supportive-expressive dynamic psychotherapy (16 sessions) gave significant improvements over one-session MI. Courses of other types of therapy (social support group, case management) gave similar improvements to CBT based on limited data. Limited data indicated that telephone- or internet-based interventions might be effective. Contingency management (vouchers for abstinence) gave promising results in the short term; however, at later follow-ups, vouchers in combination with CBT gave better results than vouchers or CBT alone. Psychiatric population studies: seven studies assessed psychiatric populations (schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar disorder or major depression). CBT appeared to have little effect over treatment as usual (TAU) based on four small studies with design limitations (both groups received TAU and patients were referred). Other studies reported no significant difference between types of 10-session therapy. LIMITATIONS: Included studies were heterogeneous, covering a wide range of interventions, comparators, populations and outcomes. The majority were considered at high risk of bias. Effect sizes were reported in different formats across studies and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, courses of CBT and (to a lesser extent) one or two sessions of MI improved outcomes in a self-selected population of cannabis users. There was some evidence that contingency management enhanced long-term outcomes in combination with CBT. Results of CBT for cannabis cessation in psychiatric populations were less promising, but may have been affected by provision of TAU in both groups and the referred populations. Future research should focus on the number of CBT/MI sessions required and potential clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of shorter interventions. CBT plus contingency management and mutual aid therapies warrant further study. Studies should consider potential effects of recruitment methods and include inactive control groups and long-term follow-up. TAU arms in psychiatric population studies should aim not to confound the study intervention. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42014008952.

METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study included 65 elderly patients with unipolar or bipolar MD, aged 60-85 years, treated with formula-based ECT. Treatment outcome was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17). Cognitive function at baseline was assessed using nine neuropsychological tests or subtests measuring information processing speed, verbal learning and memory, and aspects of executive function. RESULTS: A poorer performance on the word reading task of the Color Word Interference Test rendered higher odds of achieving remission during the ECT course (p=0.021). Remission was defined as an HRSD17 score of 7 or less. There were no other significant associations between the treatment outcome of ECT and cognitive performance parameters assessed at baseline. LIMITATIONS: The limited number of subjects may have reduced the generalizability of the findings. Multiple statistical tests increase the risk for making a type I error.

While the somatosensory functions of the anterior parietal cortex are well established, the posterior parietal cortex has a relevant role in processing the sensory information, including visuo-spatial perception, visual attention, visuo-motor transformations and other complex and not completely understood functions. We retrospectively analysed all the clinical manifestations induced by intracerebral bipolar electrical stimulation in 172 patients suffering from drug-resistant focal epilepsy (mean age 25.6, standard deviation 11.6; 44% females and 56% males) with at least one electrode stereotactically implanted in the parietal cortex. A total of 1186 electrical stimulations were included in the analysis, of which 88 were subsequently excluded because of eliciting pathological electric activity or inducing ictal symptomatology. In the dominant parietal lobe, clinical responses were observed for 56 (25%) of the low-frequency stimulations and for 76 (50%) of the high-frequency stimulations. In the non-dominant parietal lobe, 111 (27%) low-frequency and 176 (55%) high-frequency stimulations were associated with a clinical response. Body scheme alteration was the only clinical effect showing a lateralization, as they were evoked only in the non-dominant hemisphere. The occurrence of somatosensory sensations, motor symptoms, dysarthria and multimodal responses were significantly associated with stimulation of the postcentral gyrus (odds ratio: 5.83, P < 0.001; odds ratio: 8.77, P < 0.001; odds ratio: 5.44, P = 0.011; odds ratio: 8.33, P = 0.006; respectively). Stimulation of the intraparietal sulcus was associated with the occurrence of sensory illusions or hallucinations (odds ratio: 8.68, P < 0.001) and eyeball/eyelid movements or sensations (odds ratio: 4.35, P = 0.047). To our knowledge, this is the only currently available complete revision of electrical stimulation of the entire parietal cortex with the aim to evaluate the neurophysiology of this relevant brain region.

Cognitive remediation (CR) may improve cognitive function in schizophrenia but no randomised controlled trial has investigated this intervention in BD. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of CR on persistent cognitive dysfunction in BD. METHOD: Patients with BD in partial remission with cognitive complaints were randomised to 12 weeks group-based CR (n=23) or standard treatment (ST) (n=23). Outcomes were improved verbal memory (primary), sustained attention, executive and psychosocial function (secondary) and additional measures of cognitive and psychosocial function (tertiary). Participants were assessed at baseline and weeks 12 and 26. RESULTS: Of the 46 randomised participants five dropped out and one was excluded after baseline. CR (n=18) had no effect on primary or secondary measures of cognitive or psychosocial function compared with ST (n=22). However, CR improved subjective sharpness at week 12, and quality of life and verbal fluency at week 26 follow-up (tertiary outcomes). Although the trial turned out to have suboptimal statistical power for the primary outcome analysis, calculation of the 95% confidence interval showed that it was highly unlikely that an increase in sample size would have rendered any beneficial effects of CR vs. ST on the verbal memory. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term group-based CR did not seem to improve overall cognitive or psychosocial function in individuals with BD in full or partial remission. The present findings suggest that that longer-term, more intensive and individualised CR may be necessary to improve cognition in BD.

All patients were in remission. The subjects were classified according to the staging model: 31 subjects were classified as stage I, 44 as stage II, 31 as stage III, and 23 as stage IV. Results: Patterns of pharmacological treatment differed among the four stages (p = 0.001). Monotherapy was more frequent in stage I, and two-drug combinations in stage II. Patients at stages III and IV needed three or more medications or clozapine. Impairment in functional status (Functioning Assessment Short Test [FAST] scale scores) correlated positively with the number of medications prescribed. Conclusions: This study demonstrated differences in pharmacological treatment in patients with stable BD depending on disease stage. Treatment response can change with progression of BD. Clinical guidelines could consider the staging model to guide treatment effectiveness. .",20150619,37,2,10.1590/1516-4446-2014-1554,1516-4446

For some patients in a treatment resistant depressive episode, electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) is the only treatment that is effective. Although ECT has shown efficacy in randomized controlled trials, the treatment is still controversial and stigmatized. This can in part be attributed to our lack of knowledge of the mechanisms of action. Some reports also suggest potential harmful effects of ECT treatment and memory related side effects have been documented. METHODS/DESIGN: The present study will apply state of the art radiology through advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to investigate structural and functional brain effects of ECT. As a multi-disciplinary collaboration, imaging findings will be correlated to psychiatric response parameters, neuropsychological functioning as well as neurochemical and genetic biomarkers that can elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The aim is to document both treatment effects and potential harmful effects of ECT. SAMPLE: n = 40 patients in a major depressive episode (bipolar and major depressive disorder). Two control groups with n = 15 in each group: age and gender matched healthy volunteers not receiving ECT and patients undergoing electrical cardioversion (ECV) for atrial fibrillation (AF).

According to these criteria, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing efficacy are required for a treatment to be designated as 'efficacious' and 1 RCT for a designation as 'possibly efficacious'. Applying these criteria modified by Chambless and Hollon, this article presents an update on the evidence for psychodynamic therapy (PDT) in specific mental disorders. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using the criteria by Chambless and Hollon for study selection, as follows: (1) RCT of PDT in adults, (2) use of reliable and valid measures for diagnosis and outcome, (3) use of treatment manuals or manual-like guidelines, (4) adult population treated for specific problems and (5) PDT superior to no treatment, placebo or alternative treatment or equivalent to an established treatment. RESULTS: A total of 39 RCTs were included. Following Chambless and Hollon, PDT can presently be designated as efficacious in major depressive disorder (MDD), social anxiety disorder, borderline and heterogeneous personality disorders, somatoform pain disorder, and anorexia nervosa. For MDD, this also applies to the combination with pharmacotherapy. PDT can be considered as possibly efficacious in dysthymia, complicated grief, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and substance abuse/dependence. Evidence is lacking for obsessive-compulsive, posttraumatic stress, bipolar and schizophrenia spectrum disorder(s). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence has emerged that PDT is efficacious or possibly efficacious in a wide range of common mental disorders.

Little is known about how treatment, especially lithium, influences decision-making abilities in bipolar patients when euthymic. We aimed at testing for an association between lithium medication and decision-making performance in remitted bipolar patients. Decision-making was measured using the Iowa Gambling Task in 3 groups of subjects: 34 and 56 euthymic outpatients with bipolar disorder, treated with lithium (monotherapy and lithium combined with anticonvulsant or antipsychotic) and without lithium (anticonvulsant, antipsychotic and combination treatment), respectively, and 152 matched healthy controls. Performance was compared between the 3 groups. In the 90 euthymic patients, the relationship between different sociodemographic and clinical variables and decision-making was assessed by stepwise multivariate regression analysis. Euthymic patients with lithium (p=0.007) and healthy controls (p=0.001) selected significantly more cards from the safe decks than euthymic patients without lithium, with no significant difference between euthymic patients with lithium and healthy controls (p=0.9). In the 90 euthymic patients, the stepwise linear multivariate regression revealed that decision-making was significantly predicted (p<0.001) by lithium dose, level of education and no family history of bipolar disorder (all p&#8804;0.01). Because medication was not randomized, it was not possible to discriminate the effect of different medications.

This cross-sectional study, including 33 patients with UD, 33 patients with BD, and 34 healthy controls, is one of the first to directly compare UD and BD with respect to reward processing. A card-guessing paradigm was employed and brain activity associated with reward processing was investigated by means of fMRI. A 3 (group) × 2 (condition: reward>control, loss>control) ANOVA was conducted using the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) as ROI. Furthermore, a whole-brain approach was applied. A functional connectivity analysis was performed to characterize diagnosis-related alterations in the functional coupling between the NAcc and other brain areas. The ANOVA revealed higher activity for healthy controls (HCs) than for BD and UD in the NAcc during reward processing. Moreover, UD showed a higher functional connectivity between the NAcc and the VTA than HC. The patients groups could be differentiated in that BD showed a decreased activation, in the reward condition, of the NAcc, caudate nucleus, thalamus, putamen, insula, and prefrontal areas compared with UD. These results may help to refine the understanding of neural correlates of reward processing in both disorders, and to understand the neural underpinnings of anhedonia, a core symptom of depressive episodes.",20150417,40,11,10.1038/npp.2015.110,1740-634X

Lifestyle interventions targeting these risk factors have begun to be developed for those with serious mental illness, but they have largely been created de novo rather than with information from work already done in the general population. This review aims to synthesize for a mental health audience the common factors for success in nonpharmacologic lifestyle interventions and identify specific considerations in adapting these models for those with serious mental illness. DATA SOURCES: We searched the PubMed and Cochrane databases for English-language reviews from 2003 to 2013. The search employed combinations of the following terms: diabetes, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, mental illness, schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar disorder, lifestyle intervention, non-pharmacologic intervention, lifestyle modification, and weight gain. STUDY SELECTION: We identified 8,147 review articles from the PubMed and Cochrane databases. 123 articles were selected. The selected articles were reviews of dietary, behavioral, or exercise interventions that focused on obesity and related cardiometabolic risk factors. DATA EXTRACTION: We undertook a qualitative review of reviews focusing on nonpharmacologic interventions for obesity and related cardiometabolic risk factors. RESULTS: Effects of interventions in the general population were meaningful but generally modest. Specific elements of diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy produced larger effects. Additionally, successful programs employed multiple components, personalization, longer duration, more frequent contact, and trained treatment providers. Interventions addressing these risk factors in people with serious mental illness typically incorporated some, but not all, of the elements demonstrated to be effective in general medical populations. CONCLUSIONS: Studies from the general medical literature demonstrate considerable promise in addressing lifestyle risk factors. Existing programs will require tailoring to address the needs of those with serious mental illness and may be harder to implement given the challenges faced by this population. However, successful lifestyle interventions for those with serious mental illness can make a significant impact on the health and well-being of this vulnerable population and may inform future strategies for other underserved groups.",20150429,76,4,10.4088/JCP.13r08657,1555-2101

However, although Right Unilateral-Ultrabrief (0.3 ms) (RUL-UB) ECT is increasingly used in clinical settings as an effective form of ECT with minimal cognitive effects, there is sparse data regarding predictors of ST. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between ST and clinical and demographic factors in a sample of patients treated with RUL-UB ECT. METHODS: Clinical, demographic and ECT data from 179 patients in ECT research studies were examined. Seizure threshold was titrated at the first ECT session. ECT was performed with a Thymatron(®) or Mecta(®) device, with thiopentone (2.5-5 mg/kg) or propofol (1-2 mg/kg) anaesthesia. Medications taken at the time of ST titration were documented. The association between ST and candidate predictor variables was examined with regression analysis. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses showed that 34% of the variance in ST (P < 0.001) could be predicted. Older age (R(2) = 0.194, P < 0.001), propofol (vs thiopentone) (R(2) = 0.029, P &#8804; 0.01) and higher anaesthetic dose (mg in propofol equivalents) (R(2) = 0.029, P < 0.05) were found to be predictors of higher initial ST. Treatment with lithium (R(2) = 0.043, P < 0.01) and study site (R(2) = 0.019, P < 0.05) significantly predicted lower initial ST. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical titration is recommended for accurate determination of ST in patients receiving RUL-UB ECT. Novel findings of this study are that propofol anaesthesia resulted in higher ST than thiopentone and concomitant treatment with lithium treatment lowered ST.",20150217,8,3,10.1016/j.brs.2014.12.012,1876-4754

Previously it was assumed that cognitive abilities progressively deteriorate with illness onset. However, recent research results have contradicted this with observations of continuous or even improved performance in individuals at risk for psychosis or manifest schizophrenia. The objective of our longitudinal study was to examine neurocognitive functioning in help-seeking individuals meeting basic symptoms or ultra-high-risk criteria for schizophrenic psychosis (HRSchiz) or risk criteria for affective psychosis (HRBip). The progression of cognitive functioning in individuals converting to psychosis was compared with that of at-risk individuals who did not convert during the follow-up period. METHOD: Data were available from 86 study participants who completed neurocognitive and clinical assessments at baseline and, on average, 12.8 (s.d. = 1.5) months later. Neurocognitive measures were grouped according to their load in factor analysis to five cognitive domains: speed, attention, fluency, learning and memory, and working memory. RESULTS: Neurocognitive functioning in HRSchiz and HRBip individuals generally improved over time. Subjects converting to manifest psychosis displayed a stable neurocognitive profile from baseline to follow-up.

This paper reports on the results of a 12-months randomised controlled trial, which examined the efficacy of an Internet-based preventive program for bipolar disorder, adjunctive to usual pharmacological management. METHODS: Participants were recruited by completing an online screening questionnaire accessed through the Black Dog Institute and Sentiens websites based in Australia. The treatment was predominantly psycho-educational with cognitive behavioral therapy optional elements. The attention control treatment comprised directing subjects to a variety of websites focused on 'healthy living'. Time to recurrence was determined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The main outcome measures were recurrence as defined by: (i) depressive and/or hypomanic symptomatology and functional capacity (using Beck Depression Inventory, Internal State Scale and Sheehan Disability Scale) and (ii) hospitalization. RESULTS: Two-hundred-and-thirty-three subjects were randomized to the active or control treatment groups. There were no significant differences between the active and control treatment groups on any of the definitions of recurrence. LIMITATIONS: Reliance on an online self-report tool to confirm diagnosis and hospitalization rates may have potentially allowed for inclusion of individuals with other diagnoses such as borderline personality disorder. The 'attention control' treatment may have included more 'active' components than intended. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report examining the efficacy of a randomized controlled web-based psychological intervention in a large sample of subjects with bipolar disorder. The potential reasons for failing to demonstrate a significant difference compared to the active control are discussed.",20150103,174,,10.1016/j.jad.2014.11.038,1573-2517

METHOD: Alongside psychiatric care, interepisode bipolar disorder I participants with insomnia were randomly allocated to a bipolar disorder-specific modification of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBTI-BP; n = 30) or psychoeducation (PE; n = 28) as a comparison condition. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, the end of 8 sessions of treatment, and 6 months later. This pilot was conducted to determine initial feasibility and generate effect size estimates. RESULTS: During the 6-month follow-up, the CBTI-BP group had fewer days in a bipolar episode relative to the PE group (3.3 days vs. 25.5 days). The CBTI-BP group also experienced a significantly lower hypomania/mania relapse rate (4.6% vs. 31.6%) and a marginally lower overall mood episode relapse rate (13.6% vs. 42.1%) compared with the PE group. Relative to PE, CBTI-BP reduced insomnia severity and led to higher rates of insomnia remission at posttreatment and marginally higher rates at 6 months. Both CBTI-BP and PE showed statistically significant improvement on selected sleep and functional impairment measures. The effects of treatment were well sustained through follow-up for most outcomes, although some decline on secondary sleep benefits was observed. CONCLUSIONS: CBTI-BP was associated with reduced risk of mood episode relapse and improved sleep and functioning on certain outcomes in bipolar disorder. Hence, sleep disturbance appears to be an important pathway contributing to bipolar disorder. The need to develop bipolar disorder-specific sleep diary scoring standards is highlighted.",20150127,83,3,10.1037/a0038655,1939-2117

Although medication attitudes are believed to be relevant to adherence behavior, few studies have investigated the trajectories of adherence change. This study evaluated attitudinal correlates of adherence conversion in 86 poorly adherent individuals with BD. METHODS: This secondary analysis pooled data from two uncontrolled prospective trials of customized adherence enhancement (CAE), a psychosocial intervention delivered over 4-6 weeks. Poor adherence was defined as missing at least 20% of prescribed BD medication based on the self-reported Tablets Routine Questionnaire (TRQ). The sample was dichotomized into converters who achieved good adherence (N=44) and non-converters who remained poorly adherent (N=21). Converters vs. non-converters were compared on adherence, attitudes, and symptoms at baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months. RESULTS: At baseline, converters and non-converters were similar demographically and clinically, but converters were less non-adherent (32% doses missed) than non-converters (59% missed). At 6 weeks, converters had better attitudes than non-converters. At 3 months, converters maintained improvements, but group differences were less pronounced due to some improvement in non-converters. Converters had better adherence at 3 months and trajectories differed for the groups on attitudes. Symptoms gradually improved for both converters and non-converters. CONCLUSIONS: Over two-thirds of poorly adherent BD patients who received CAE converted to good adherence. Improved medication attitudes may be a driver of improved adherence behavior and ultimately reduce BD symptoms.",20150126,58,,10.1016/j.comppsych.2014.11.023,1532-8384

The current study builds on primary findings by examining baseline child, parent, and family characteristics as moderators of symptom response trajectories. METHOD: A total of 69 youth aged 7 to 13 years (mean = 9.19 years, SD = 1.61 years) with DSM-IV-TR bipolar I, II, or not otherwise specified (NOS) were randomly assigned, with family members, to CFF-CBT or TAU. Both treatments consisted of 12 weekly sessions and 6 monthly booster sessions. Participants were assessed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and 6-month follow-up on mania and depression symptoms and overall psychiatric severity. Parents and youth also provided self-report data on baseline characteristics. RESULTS: CFF-CBT demonstrated greater efficacy for youth depressive symptoms relative to TAU for parents with higher baseline depressive symptoms and lower income, and marginally for families with higher cohesion. In addition, youth with lower baseline depression and youth with higher self-esteem showed a poorer response to TAU versus CFF-CBT on mania symptom outcomes. Age, sex, baseline mania symptoms, comorbidity, and suicidality did not moderate treatment response. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that CFF-CBT was relatively immune to the presence of treatment moderators.

METHODS: This single-site, randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled trial was conducted from 2009 to 2013. Seventy-three elderly patients with MD, unipolar and bipolar, were treated with a course of formula-based BF ECT or RUL ECT. The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17) was used to measure efficacy. Safety was assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: Both electrode placements resulted in highly significant downward trends in symptom severity (all p<0.001), with a non-significant difference between methods (p=0.703). At the end of the ECT course, response rates for the BF and RUL group were 63.9% and 67.6%, respectively. Short-term remission, defined as an HRSD17 score&#8804;7, was achieved in 14 (38.9%) patients in the BF group and 19 (51.4%) patients in the RUL group. Global cognitive function, as measured by the MMSE, did not deteriorate in the two treatment groups. LIMITATIONS: The small number of subjects may have led to reduced power to detect real differences. The MMSE is not sufficient to ascertain the negative effect of ECT on cognition. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that formula-based BF and RUL ECT are equally efficacious, and that remission rates of formula-based dosing are lower than those previously reported for titrated dosing, in a clinical sample of elderly patients with MD.

We report here a comparative evaluation of two online programs hosted on a single website (www.moodswings.net.au). A basic version, called MoodSwings (MS), contains psychoeducation material and asynchronous discussion boards; and a more interactive program, MoodSwings Plus (MS-Plus), combined the basic psychoeducation material and discussion boards with elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. These programs were evaluated in a head-to-head study design. METHOD: Participants with Bipolar I or II disorder (n=156) were randomized to receive either MoodSwings or MoodSwings-Plus. Outcomes included mood symptoms, the occurrence of relapse, functionality, Locus of Control, social support, quality of life and medication adherence. RESULTS: Participants in both groups showed baseline to endpoint reductions in mood symptoms and improvements in functionality, quality of life and medication adherence. The MoodSwings-Plus group showed a greater number of within-group changes on symptoms and functioning in depression and mania, quality of life and social support, across both poles of the illness. MoodSwings-Plus was superior to MoodSwings in improvement on symptoms of mania scores at 12 months (p=0.02) but not on the incidence of recurrence. LIMITATIONS: The study did not have an attention control group and therefore could not demonstrate efficacy of the two active arms. There was notable (81%) attrition by 12 months from baseline.

Up to now, the mechanisms behind why some bipolar patients (BP) do not reach their former level of cognitive performance and psychosocial functioning while others remit completely, are not understood. In this study we aimed to identify a cognitive deficit vs. non-deficit subgroup within BD by using an extensive neuropsychological test battery. The test performance of 70 euthymic outpatients (BD-I and II, recruited as a sample of convenience from our bipolar disorder programme) was compared to 70 matched, healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, we investigated the association between demographic/clinical variables and the cognitive performance of BP. As expected, our sample of euthymic BP performed significantly worse than HC in psychomotor speed, divided attention, working memory, verbal memory, word fluency and problem solving. However, 41.4% of the patients did not have any neurocognitive deficits at all, and whether or not a patient belonged to the non-deficit group was not influenced by disease severity. Instead, our results demonstrate that patients suffering from persistent sleep disturbances and sub-threshold depressive symptomatology show more severe cognitive dysfunctions. In addition, antipsychotic treatment and comorbid anxiety disorder were associated with cognitive deficits.

In human and non-human studies, lithium has been related to neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. We explored whether lithium treatment is related to better brain integrity and cognitive function in older adults with BD.

Subjects received comprehensive neurocognitive assessment and structural brain imaging, examining total gray matter volume, overall white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy), and total white matter hyperintensity burden. RESULTS: In comparison to controls, subjects with BD had worse overall cognitive performance, lower total gray matter volume, and lower white matter integrity. Among subjects with BD, longer duration of lithium treatment was related to higher white matter integrity after controlling for age and vascular disease burden, but not with better cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium treatment appears to be related to better brain integrity in older individuals with BD, in particular, in those who take lithium long-term.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate bipolar patients' quality of life and to identify the risk factors responsible for a deterioration. DESIGN: Our cross-sectional study lasted for four months and included 104 bipolar patients treated at the psychiatry consultation of the university hospital in Mahdia. The data were collected through a questionnaire composed of 52 items exploring the general characteristics of subjects, the clinical and evolutional characteristics of bipolar disorder and providing information on the treatment. Quality of life was measured using the SF-36 (Short form) generic scale. A global average score was calculated and it was considered that quality of life was altered if the score was less than 66.7, according to the threshold value of Léan. Moreover, an average score was calculated for each dimension, thus permitting us to identify those most affected. We standardized initial average scores. RESULTS: The assessment of quality of life revealed a global average of 52.2 and an alteration in 78.8% of patients. The study of the dimensional average scores revealed that all dimensions were affected. The standardization also revealed deterioration in all dimensions, the mental component being particularly more affected than the physical component with respectively estimated scores of 31.7 and 40.5. The analytic approach concerned the relationship between qualitative and quantitative variables and the occurrence of an alteration in quality of life. For this effect, a bivariate study displayed a statistically significant correlation between the eight dimensions of the SF-36 and 8 variables. In order to take into account the relationships that link each variable to the others, and to avoid the bias of the bivariate study, a logistic regression analysis was performed. Only 4 variables with discriminating weight emerged from this analysis. According to the number of dimensions affected, the following factors were classified in decreasing order: absence of leisure activities, lack of stable budgetary resources, absence of professional activity and the association of a psychotropic medication. CONCLUSION: This clinimetric approach permitted us to consider the global life of each patient suffering from bipolar disorder.",20140921,41,4,10.1016/j.encep.2014.06.002,0013-7006

METHOD: Thirty interepisode individuals with bipolar disorder and comorbid insomnia (ages 21-62 years, 56.7% women, 56.7% Caucasian) participated in a randomized controlled trial of psychotherapies. Patients received either cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBTI-BP; n = 17) or psychoeducation (PE; n = 13). At the beginning of each weekly session, patients freely recalled as many therapy points (i.e., distinct ideas, principles, and experiences) as they could from their previous session. After each session, therapists recorded a list of all therapy points delivered. Treatment outcome was measured via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Info System-Sleep, and Quality of Life-Sleep (QOL-Sleep), administered pre- and posttreatment, and treatment evaluation questions administered posttreatment. RESULTS: Patients recalled 19.6% to 36.9% of therapy points listed by therapists. Raw numbers of therapy points recalled were positively correlated with reductions in ISI scores and gains in QOL-Sleep and with most treatment evaluation questions. Percentages of therapy points recalled were positively correlated with gains in QOL-Sleep but with no other sleep outcome measures or any of the treatment evaluation questions.

AIMS: A pilot study to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a new intervention, recovery-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), designed in collaboration with individuals with recent-onset bipolar disorder intended to improve clinical and personal recovery outcomes. METHOD: A single, blind randomised controlled trial compared treatment as usual (TAU) with recovery-focused CBT plus TAU (n = 67). RESULTS: Recruitment and follow-up rates within 10% of pre-planned targets to 12-month follow-up were achieved. An average of 14.15 h (s.d. = 4.21) of recovery-focused CBT were attended out of a potential maximum of 18 h.

The sample included 101 subjects: 52 patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for BD type I or II and 49 healthy controls (HC) matched for age and gender. They were all assessed with a cognitive battery tapping into executive and memory functioning. CR was obtained using three different proxies: education-occupation, leisure activities and premorbid IQ. Psychosocial functioning was evaluated by means of the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST). MANCOVAs were performed to determine differences in cognitive and functioning variables. Linear regression analyses were carried out to predict neuropsychological and psychosocial outcomes. Euthymic bipolar patients showed worse neuropsychological performance and psychosocial functioning than HC. The linear regression models revealed that CR was significantly predictive of FAST score (ß = -0.47, p < 0.0001), Executive Index (ß = 0.62, p < 0.0001) and Visual Memory Index (ß = 0.44, p = 0.0004), indicating that CR is a significant predictor of cognitive and psychosocial functioning in euthymic bipolar outpatients.

However, its characteristics in manic states have not been well understood. Thus, we compared prefrontal hemodynamic responses during a cognitive task between hypomanic and depressive states in BD. We then longitudinally compared hypomanic and subsequent euthymic states. METHODS: The prefrontal function of 27 patients with BD (11 hypomanic and 16 depressed) and 12 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) was evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a verbal fluency task (VFT). Hypomanic symptoms were assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale. Among the 11 hypomanic patients, eight participated in the second NIRS measurement after their hypomanic symptoms resolved. RESULTS: VFT performance did not differ among hypomanic, depressed, and HC groups. Both BD groups exhibited significantly lower activation during the VFT than HCs in the broader bilateral prefrontal cortex. Hemodynamic changes in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the hypomanic patients with BD were significantly larger than those in the depressed patients. In addition, hypomanic symptom severity was positively correlated with activation in the left DLPFC and frontopolar cortex in patients with BD. Follow-up measurement of the hypomanic patients revealed that prefrontal activation was decreased after hypomanic symptoms resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Combining cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments, the present results suggest that prefrontal hemodynamic responses associated with cognitive activation differ between hypomanic and depressive states in BD. NIRS measurement could be a useful tool for objectively evaluating state-dependent characteristics of prefrontal hemodynamics in BD.",20140905,17,2,10.1111/bdi.12252,1399-5618

Participants were assessed at baseline and prospectively for 72 weeks using the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE) scale scores for mania/hypomania and depression, as well as comparison measures (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00188838). RESULTS: Over a 72-week period, patients spent a clear majority (about 65%) of time euthymic. Symptoms were experienced more than 50% of the time by only a quarter of the sample. Depressive symptoms strongly dominated over (hypo)manic symptoms, while subsyndromal symptoms were more common than full diagnosable episodes for both polarities. Mixed symptoms were rare, but present for a minority of participants. Individuals experienced approximately six significant mood changes per year, with a full relapse on average every 7.5 months.

METHODS: We recruited participants 12-18 years of age with a primary BP diagnosis (I, II, or operationalized not otherwise specified [NOS] criteria) from a pediatric specialty clinic. Eligible patients were assigned using a 2:1 randomization structure to either DBT (n=14) or psychosocial TAU (n=6). All patients received medication management from a study-affiliated psychiatrist. DBT included 36 sessions (18 individual, 18 family skills training) over 1 year. TAU was an eclectic psychotherapy approach consisting of psychoeducational, supportive, and cognitive behavioral techniques. An independent evaluator, blind to treatment condition, assessed outcomes including affective symptoms, suicidal ideation and behavior, nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior, and emotional dysregulation, quarterly over 1 year. RESULTS: Adolescents receiving DBT attended significantly more therapy sessions over 1 year than did adolescents receiving TAU, possibly reflecting greater engagement and retention; both treatments were rated as highly acceptable by adolescents and parents. As compared with adolescents receiving TAU, adolescents receiving DBT demonstrated significantly less severe depressive symptoms over follow-up, and were nearly three times more likely to demonstrate improvement in suicidal ideation. Models indicate a large effect size, for more weeks being euthymic, over follow-up among adolescents receiving DBT. Although there were no between-group differences in manic symptoms or emotional dysregulation with treatment, adolescents receiving DBT, but not those receiving TAU, evidenced improvement from pre- to posttreatment in both manic symptoms and emotional dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS: DBT may offer promise as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation for adolescents with BP. The DBT focus on commitment to treatment may be important for the treatment of early-onset BP. Larger controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of this approach, examine impact on suicidal behavior, and demonstrate cost effectiveness.",20140711,25,2,10.1089/cap.2013.0145,1557-8992

Alterations in these systems, in particular in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC), seem to play a central role in bipolar disorder (BD). However, the exact role of the PACC, and its functional connections to other midline regions (within and outside DMN) still remains unclear in BD. METHODS: We investigated functional connectivity (FC), standard deviation (SD, as a measure of neuronal variability) and their correlation in bipolar patients (n = 40) versus healthy controls (n = 40), in the PACC and in its connections in different frequency bands (standard: 0.01-0.10 Hz; Slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; Slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz). Finally, we studied the correlations between FC alterations and clinical-neuropsychological parameters and we explored whether subgroups of patients in different phases of the illness present different patterns of FC abnormalities. RESULTS: We found in BD decreased FC (especially in Slow-5) from the PACC to other regions located predominantly in the posterior DMN (such as the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and inferior temporal gyrus) and in the SN (such as the supragenual anterior cingulate cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex). Second, we found in BD a decoupling between PACC-based FC and variability in the various target regions (without alteration in variability itself). Finally, in our subgroups explorative analysis, we found a decrease in FC between the PACC and supragenual ACC (in depressive phase) and between the PACC and PCC (in manic phase). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in BD the communication, that is, information transfer, between the different cortical midline regions within the cingulate gyrus does not seem to work properly. This may result in dysbalance between different resting state networks like the DMN and SN. A deficit in the anterior DMN-SN connectivity could lead to an abnormal shifting toward the DMN, while a deficit in the anterior DMN-posterior DMN connectivity could lead to an abnormal shifting toward the SN, resulting in excessive focusing on internal contents and reduced transition from idea to action or in excessive focusing on external contents and increased transition from idea to action, respectively, which could represent central dimensions of depression and mania. If confirmed, they could represent diagnostic markers in BD.",20141014,36,2,10.1002/hbm.22655,1097-0193

The objective of this general overview is to briefly review the evidence for cognitive impairment in MDD and to summarize a representative sample of cognitive assessment tools currently available to assess cognitive function in depressed patients. Study results in MDD patients with cognitive dysfunction are somewhat inconsistent, likely due to the heterogeneity of the disorder as well as the use of diverse assessment tools. Measuring cognitive changes in this population is challenging. Cognitive symptoms are typically less severe than in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, requiring greater sensitivity than afforded by existing tools. Preliminary evidence suggests antidepressant treatments may improve cognitive functioning as a direct result of ameliorating depressive symptoms; however, any procognitive effects have not been elucidated. To evaluate antidepressant efficacy in MDD patients with cognitive dysfunction, a standardized cognitive battery for use in clinical trials is essential.",20141126,32,4,10.1002/da.22297,1520-6394

The aim of this study was to determine the progress over two years in neuropsychological performance of a sample of medicated adolescents with EOBD compared to healthy controls (HC). METHODS: Twenty adolescents, diagnosed in clinical setting as DSM-IV bipolar disorder, treated for two years, euthymic, and 20 gender and age-matched HC were assessed at two moments in reasoning, verbal and visual memory, working memory, speed, visual-motor skills and executive function. Multivariate analyses of variance was carried out to analyze the differences between groups over time, and to monitor the influence of psychotic symptoms and type of mood-stabilizer. RESULTS: The entire sample improved on verbal and visual memory tests (verbal recall p<0.01; visual recall p<0.001). Moreover, patients improved more than controls in verbal reasoning (p<0.01), working memory (p<0.01), processing speed (p<0.01) and visual-motor skills (p<0.001).

Although psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy have proven efficacious in randomized clinical trials, geographic barriers impede rural veterans from engaging in these evidence-based treatments. OBJECTIVE: To test a telemedicine-based collaborative care model designed to improve engagement in evidence-based treatment of PTSD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Telemedicine Outreach for PTSD (TOP) study used a pragmatic randomized effectiveness trial design with intention-to-treat analyses. Outpatients were recruited from 11 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) community-based outpatient clinics serving predominantly rural veterans. Inclusion required meeting diagnostic criteria for current PTSD according to the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Exclusion criteria included receiving PTSD treatment at a VA medical center or a current diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or substance dependence. Two hundred sixty-five veterans were enrolled from November 23, 2009, through September 28, 2011, randomized to usual care (UC) or the TOP intervention, and followed up for 12 months. INTERVENTIONS: Off-site PTSD care teams located at VA medical centers supported on-site community-based outpatient clinic providers. Off-site PTSD care teams included telephone nurse care managers, telephone pharmacists, telepsychologists, and telepsychiatrists. Nurses conducted care management activities. Pharmacists reviewed medication histories. Psychologists delivered cognitive processing therapy via interactive video. Psychiatrists supervised the team and conducted interactive video psychiatric consultations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was PTSD severity as measured by the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale. Process-of-care outcomes included medication prescribing and regimen adherence and initiation of and adherence to cognitive processing therapy. RESULTS: During the 12-month follow-up period, 73 of the 133 patients randomized to TOP (54.9%) received cognitive processing therapy compared with 16 of 132 randomized to UC (12.1%) (odds ratio, 18.08 [95% CI, 7.96-41.06]; P < .001). Patients in the TOP arm had significantly larger decreases in Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale scores (from 35.0 to 29.1) compared with those in the UC arm (from 33.5 to 32.1) at 6 months (ß = -3.81; P = .002). Patients in the TOP arm also had significantly larger decreases in Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale scores (from 35.0 to 30.1) compared with those in the UC arm (from 33.5 to 31.7) at 12 months (ß = -2.49; P=.04). There were no significant group differences in the number of PTSD medications prescribed and adherence to medication regimens were not significant. Attendance at 8 or more sessions of cognitive processing therapy significantly predicted improvement in Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale scores (ß = -3.86 [95% CI, -7.19 to -0.54]; P = .02) and fully mediated the intervention effect at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Telemedicine-based collaborative care can successfully engage rural veterans in evidence-based psychotherapy to improve PTSD outcomes.

We addressed this question through a systematic review concerning the prevalence, clinical impact, etiology and treatment of main comorbid disorders involved. METHOD: A comprehensive database search was performed from 1990 to August 2014. Overall, 167 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Bipolar youth tend to suffer from comorbid disorders, with highest weighted mean prevalence rate arising from anxiety disorders (54%), followed by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (48%), disruptive behavior disorders (31%), and substance use disorders (SUD) (31%). Furthermore, evidence indicates that ADHD and anxiety disorders negatively affect the symptomatology, neurocognitive profile, clinical course and the global functioning of PBD. Likewise, several theories have been posited to explain comorbidity rates in PBD, specifically common risk factors, one disorder being a risk factor for the other and nosological artefacts. Lastly, randomized controlled trials highlight a stronger therapeutic response to stimulants and atomoxetine (vs. placebo) as adjunctive interventions for comorbid ADHD symptoms. In addition, research focused on the treatment of other comorbid disorders postulates some benefits from mood stabilizers and/or SGA. LIMITATIONS: Epidemiologic follow-up studies are needed to avoid the risk of nosological artefacts. Likewise, more research is needed on pervasive developmental disorders and anxiety disorders, especially regarding their etiology and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric comorbidity is highly prevalent and is associated with a deleterious clinical effect on pediatric bipolarity. Different etiological pathways may explain the presence of these comorbid disorders among bipolar youth.

This article describes the aims and design of a research study that takes a novel approach to targeted prevention of SMI. It is based on the rationale that early developmental antecedents to SMI are likely to be more malleable than fully developed mood or psychotic disorders and that low-risk interventions targeting antecedents may reduce the risk of SMI. METHODS/DESIGN: Families Overcoming Risks and Building Opportunities for Well-being (FORBOW) is an accelerated cohort study that includes a large proportion of offspring of parents with SMI and embeds intervention trials in a cohort multiple randomized controlled trial (cmRCT) design. Antecedents are conditions of the individual that are distressing but not severely impairing, predict SMI with moderate-to-large effect sizes and precede the onset of SMI by at least several years. FORBOW focuses on the following antecedents: affective lability, anxiety, psychotic-like experiences, basic symptoms, sleep problems, somatic symptoms, cannabis use and cognitive delay. Enrolment of offspring over a broad age range (0 to 21 years) will allow researchers to draw conclusions on a longer developmental period from a study of shorter duration. Annual assessments cover a full range of psychopathology, cognitive abilities, eligibility criteria for interventions and outcomes. Pre-emptive early interventions (PEI) will include skill training for parents of younger children and courses in emotional well-being skills based on cognitive behavioural therapy for older children and youth. A sample enriched for familial risk of SMI will enhance statistical power for testing the efficacy of PEI. DISCUSSION: FORBOW offers a platform for efficient and unbiased testing of interventions selected according to best available evidence. Since few differences exist between familial and 'sporadic' SMI, the same interventions are likely to be effective in the general population. Comparison of short-term efficacy of PEI on antecedents and the long term efficacy for preventing the onset of SMI will provide an experimental test of the etiological role of antecedents in the development of SMI.",20141203,14,,10.1186/s12888-014-0344-2,1471-244X

Typically, these approaches have focused on promoting strategies to prevent future relapse. An alternative treatment approach, termed 'Think Effectively About Mood Swings' (TEAMS) addresses current symptoms, including subclinical hypomania, depression and anxiety, and promotes long-term recovery. Following the publication of a theoretical model, a range of research studies testing the model and a case series have demonstrated positive results. The current study reports the protocol of a feasibility randomized controlled trial to inform a future multi-centre trial. METHODS/DESIGN: A target number of 84 patients with a diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder, or bipolar disorder not-otherwise-specified are screened, allocated to a baseline assessment and randomized to either 16 sessions of TEAMS therapy plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU. Patients complete self-report inventories of depression, anxiety, recovery status and bipolar cognitions targeted by TEAMS. Assessments of diagnosis, bipolar symptoms, medication, access to services and quality of life are conducted by assessors blind to treatment condition at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post-randomization. The main aim is to evaluate recruitment and retention of participants into both arms of the study, as well as adherence to therapy, to determine feasibility and acceptability. It is predicted that TEAMS plus TAU will reduce self-reported depression in comparison to TAU alone at six months post-randomization. The secondary hypotheses are that TEAMS will reduce the severity of hypomanic symptoms and anxiety, reduce bipolar cognitions, improve social functioning and promote recovery compared to TAU alone at post-treatment and follow-up. The study also incorporates semi-structured interviews about the experiences of previous treatment and the experience of TEAMS therapy that will be subject to qualitative analyses to inform future developments of the approach. DISCUSSION: The design will provide preliminary evidence of efficacy, feasibility, acceptability, uptake, attrition and barriers to treatment to design a definitive trial of this novel intervention compared to treatment as usual.

Whole brain analysis was used to identify clusters that showed differential activation to emotion vs. shapes across group. To assess pair-wise comparisons and potential confounders, mean activation data were extracted only from clusters within regions previously implicated in emotion regulation (including amygdala and ventral prefrontal regions). A cluster in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) showed group differences to emotion vs. shapes (159 voxels, corrected p < .05). Within this cluster, U-BD youth showed decreased activation relative to HC (p = .007) and non-BD (p = .004) youth. M-BD also showed decreased activation in this cluster relative to HC and non-BD youth, but these differences were attenuated.

Antipsychotic-naïve first-episode schizophrenia patients have shown intact performance on a predictive saccade task that assesses simple motor learning, spatial abilities, and response planning. After antipsychotic treatment, however, schizophrenia patients performing this task show a selective impairment in the accuracy of anticipatory responses, generated from learned internal representations of the task stimulus. This finding is in line with other observations of antipsychotic medication effects on frontostriatal systems, particularly dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We sought to replicate this provocative finding with an independent sample of antipsychotic-naïve first-episode schizophrenia patients and extend it by including a group of patients with first episode bipolar disorder with psychosis (BDP). Matched healthy controls were also studied in parallel. Schizophrenia patients demonstrated intact performance pretreatment followed by impairment post-treatment for accuracy of anticipatory responses, and worse accuracy was associated with higher antipsychotic dose. BDP patients displayed saccade accuracy deficits before and after treatment and had no correlation of performance and antipsychotic dose.

However, the roles of PCC and MPFC in providing specific distinctive and shared neural substrates between these two disorders remain largely unknown. Examining the neurophysiologic mechanism of these diseases may help explain the clinical observations and differentiate the two disorders. METHODS: We used the Dynamic Casual Modeling (DCM), which is capable of eliciting hidden neuronal dynamics and reveal cross-regulation of multiple neuronal systems, to characterize the pattern of disrupted effective connectivity in the left PCC-MPFC circuit during working memory tasks in 36 SZ and 20 BD patients as well as 29 healthy controls. RESULTS: Compared to the healthy controls, both SZ and BD patient groups exhibited significant negative effective connectivity from the left MPFC to PCC. The negative effective connectivity was more remarkable in schizophrenic patients. Only patients with BD differed from healthy controls with positive effective connectivity from the left PCC to MPFC. CONCLUSIONS: Whole brain analysis revealed deactivation of the left PCC and MPFC across all patient groups.

Little is known about how deficits evolve over the course of illness, however, and whether these changes are associated with disease progression. METHOD: Patients with bipolar I disorder (DSM-IV-TR) receiving naturalistic clinical follow-up from the Systematic Treatment Optimization Program for Early Mania (STOP-EM) from July 2004 to May 2013 completed a comprehensive cognitive battery following recovery from their first manic episode and again 1 year later. Performance was compared between patients who experienced a recurrence of a mood episode (BDrecur) (n = 26) versus those that maintained remission (BDwell) (n = 27) over follow-up, as well as healthy comparison subjects (HS) (n = 31). RESULTS: While both BDrecur and BDwell had impairments in overall cognitive performance relative to HS at baseline (mean difference = -0.59, P < .001; mean difference = -0.43, P < .05, respectively), at follow-up BDrecur showed deficits compared to both HS (mean difference = -0.62, P = .001) and BDwell (mean difference = -0.41, P = .05), with BDwell cognition similar to that in HS (mean difference = -0.21, P > .4). BDwell showed larger improvements over follow-up relative to both other groups (P < .05). While changes in BDrecur did not differ from HS, in this group more days in a manic or hypomanic episode was associated with performance declines (r = -0.40, P < .05).

METHODS: Eighty euthymic outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder and 40 healthy control comparison subjects were neuropsychologically assessed at baseline (T1) and then at follow-up of five years (T2). A neurocognitive battery including the main cognitive domains of speed of processing, working memory, attention, verbal memory, visual memory, and executive function was used to evaluate cognitive performance. RESULTS: Repeated-measures multivariate analyses showed that progression of cognitive dysfunction in patients was not different to that of control subjects in any of the six cognitive domains examined. Only a measure from the verbal memory domain, delayed free recall, worsened more in patients with bipolar disorder. Additionally, it was found that clinical course during the follow-up period did not influence the course of cognitive dysfunction.

This systematic review was conducted to evaluate pharmacologic and behavioral interventions to reduce CVD risk in adults with serious mental illness. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from January 1980 to July 2012 for English language studies. Examples of search terms used include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, antipsychotics, weight, glucose, lipid, and cardiovascular disease. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently screened citations and identified 33 randomized controlled trials of at least 2 months' duration that enrolled adults with serious mental illness and evaluated pharmacologic or behavioral interventions targeting weight, glucose, or lipid control. DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewers extracted data, assessed applicability, and evaluated study quality; the team jointly graded overall strength of evidence. RESULTS: We included 33 studies. Most studies targeted weight control (28 studies). Compared with control groups, weight control was improved with behavioral interventions (mean difference = -3.13 kg; 95% CI, -4.21 to -2.05), metformin (mean difference = -4.13 kg; 95% CI, -6.58 to -1.68), anticonvulsive medications topiramate and zonisamide (mean difference = -5.11 kg; 95% CI, -9.48 to -0.74), and adjunctive or antipsychotic switching to aripiprazole (meta-analysis not possible). Evidence was insufficient for all other interventions and for effects on glucose and lipid control. The small number of studies precluded analyses of variability in treatment effects by patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have evaluated interventions addressing 1 or more CVD risk factors in people with serious mental illness. Glucose- and lipid-related results were mainly reported as secondary outcome assessments in studies of weight-management interventions. Comparative effectiveness studies are needed to test multimodal strategies, agents known to be effective in nonserious mental illness populations, and antipsychotic-management strategies.",20140613,75,5,10.4088/JCP.13r08558,1555-2101

The long latency in clinical diagnosis (and subsequent adequate treatment) adversely affects the course of disease, effectiveness of interventions and health-related quality of life, and increases the economic burden of BD. Despite uncertainties about risk constellations and symptomatology in the early stages of potentially developing BD, many adolescents and young adults seek help, and most of them suffer substantially from symptoms already leading to impairments in psychosocial functioning in school, training, at work and in their social relationships. We aimed to identify subjects at risk of developing BD and investigate the efficacy and safety of early specific cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy (CBT) in this subpopulation. METHODS/DESIGN: EarlyCBT is a randomised controlled multi-centre clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early specific CBT, including stress management and problem solving strategies, with elements of mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) versus unstructured group meetings for 14 weeks each and follow-up until week 78. Participants are recruited at seven university hospitals throughout Germany, which provide in- and outpatient care (including early recognition centres) for psychiatric patients. Subjects at high risk must be 15 to 30 years old and meet the combination of specified affective symptomatology, reduction of psychosocial functioning, and family history for (schizo)affective disorders. Primary efficacy endpoints are differences in psychosocial functioning and defined affective symptomatology at 14 weeks between groups. Secondary endpoints include the above mentioned endpoints at 7, 24, 52 and 78 weeks and the change within groups compared to baseline; perception of, reaction to and coping with stress; and conversion to full BD. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate early specific CBT in subjects at high risk for BD. Structured diagnostic interviews are used to map the risk status and development of disease. With our study, the level of evidence for the treatment of those young patients will be significantly raised.

However, there is little robust evidence to guide the management of those whose symptoms are 'treatment resistant'. OBJECTIVE: The CoBalT trial examined the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an adjunct to usual care (including pharmacotherapy) for primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) compared with usual care alone. DESIGN: Pragmatic, multicentre individually randomised controlled trial with follow-up at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. A subset took part in a qualitative study investigating views and experiences of CBT, reasons for completing/not completing therapy, and usual care for TRD. SETTING: General practices in Bristol, Exeter and Glasgow, and surrounding areas. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-75 years who had TRD [on antidepressants for &#8805; 6 weeks, had adhered to medication, Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd version (BDI-II) score of &#8805; 14 and fulfilled the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth edition criteria for depression]. Individuals were excluded who (1) had bipolar disorder/psychosis or major alcohol/substance abuse problems; (2) were unable to complete the questionnaires; or (3) were pregnant, as were those currently receiving CBT/other psychotherapy/secondary care for depression, or who had received CBT in the past 3 years. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised, using a computer-generated code, to usual care or CBT (12-18 sessions) in addition to usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 'response', defined as &#8805; 50% reduction in depressive symptoms (BDI-II score) at 6 months compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes included BDI-II score as a continuous variable, remission of symptoms (BDI-II score of < 10), quality of life, anxiety and antidepressant use at 6 and 12 months. Data on health and social care use, personal costs, and time off work were collected at 6 and 12 months. Costs from these three perspectives were reported using a cost-consequence analysis. A cost-utility analysis compared health and social care costs with quality adjusted life-years. RESULTS: A total of 469 patients were randomised (intervention: n = 234; usual care: n = 235), with 422 participants (90%) and 396 (84%) followed up at 6 and 12 months. Ninety-five participants (46.1%) in the intervention group met criteria for 'response' at 6 months compared with 46 (21.6%) in the usual-care group {odds ratio [OR] 3.26 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.10 to 5.06], p < 0.001}. In repeated measures analyses using data from 6 and 12 months, the OR for 'response' was 2.89 (95% CI 2.03 to 4.10, p < 0.001) and for a secondary 'remission' outcome (BDI-II score of < 10) 2.74 (95% CI 1.82 to 4.13, p < 0.001). The mean cost of CBT per participant was £ 910, the incremental health and social care cost £ 850, the incremental QALY gain 0.057 and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio £ 14,911. Forty participants were interviewed. Patients described CBT as challenging but helping them to manage their depression; listed social, emotional and practical reasons for not completing treatment; and described usual care as mainly taking medication. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who have not responded to antidepressants, augmenting usual care with CBT is effective in reducing depressive symptoms, and these effects, including outcomes reflecting remission, are maintained over 12 months. The intervention was cost-effective based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold. Patients may experience CBT as difficult but effective. Further research should evaluate long-term effectiveness, as this would have major implications for the recommended treatment of depression.

RESULTS: Both therapies were effective in producing clinically significant change in depressive symptoms, with moderate-to-large effect sizes obtained. No differences were detected between therapies in overall outcome or early change on clinician-rated or self-reported measures. Post-hoc analyses suggest that MCT may have been adversely affected by greater comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: In this large pilot study conducted independently of MCT's developers, MCT was an effective treatment for outpatients with depression, with similar results overall to CBT.

This proof-of-concept study tested whether administration of an insulin-sensitizing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-Î³ agonist could reduce bipolar depression symptom severity. A secondary objective was to determine whether levels of highly sensitive C-reactive protein and interleukin (IL)-6 predicted treatment outcome. METHODS: Patients (n = 34) with bipolar disorder (I, II, or not otherwise specified) and metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance who were currently depressed (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms [QIDS] total score &#8805;11) despite an adequate trial of a mood stabilizer received open-label, adjunctive treatment with the PPAR-Î³ agonist pioglitazone (15-30 mg/day) for 8 weeks. The majority of participants (76 %, n = 26) were experiencing treatment-resistant bipolar depression, having already failed two mood stabilizers or the combination of a mood stabilizer and a conventional antidepressant. RESULTS: Supporting an association between insulin sensitization and depression severity, pioglitazone treatment was associated with a decrease in the total Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C30) score from 38.7 ± 8.2 at baseline to 21.2 ± 9.2 at week 8 (p < 0.001). Self-reported depressive symptom severity and clinician-rated anxiety symptom severity significantly improved over 8 weeks as measured by the QIDS (p < 0.001) and Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (p < 0.001), respectively. Functional improvement also occurred as measured by the change in total score on the Sheehan Disability Scale (-17.9 ± 3.6; p < 0.001). Insulin sensitivity increased from baseline to week 8 as measured by the Insulin Sensitivity Index derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (0.98 ± 0.3; p < 0.001). Higher baseline levels of IL-6 were associated with greater decrease in depression severity (parameter estimate ß = -3.89, standard error [SE] = 1.47, p = 0.015). A positive correlation was observed between improvement in IDS-C30 score and change in IL-6 (r = 0.44, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Open-label administration of the PPAR-Î³ agonist pioglitazone was associated with improvement in depressive symptoms and reduced cardio-metabolic risk.

METHODS: The present study examined the degree to which individuals with SAD and comorbid MDD (SAD+MDD; n=76), comorbid BD (SAD+BD; n=19), a comorbid anxiety disorder (SAD+ANX; n=27), or no comorbid diagnoses (SAD+NCO; n=41) benefitted from CBT for SAD. Individuals were screened using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and then completed the Social Phobia Inventory and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales before and after 12-weeks of group CBT for SAD. RESULTS: At pretreatment the SAD+MDD and SAD+BD groups reported higher social anxiety symptoms than the SAD+ANX and SAD+NCO groups. All groups reported large and significant improvement in social anxiety with CBT. However, at posttreatment the SAD+MDD and SAD+BD groups continued to have higher social anxiety symptoms than the SAD+NCO group, and the SAD+ANX group did not differ in social anxiety symptoms from any group. The sample also showed small and statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms with CBT for SAD.

However, neuropsychological safety data for this novel treatment have only been published for a small number of subjects. Moreover, little is known regarding the neuropsychological profile present in TRD patients at baseline, prior to initiation of DBS therapy. This report describes the neuropsychological effects of TRD and acute and chronic DBS of the SCCwm in patients with unipolar and bipolar TRD. METHODS: Patients with TRD (N = 17) were compared to a healthy control group (N = 15) on subtests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and the Stroop Task. Patients were then tested again at subsequent time points of 1 and 6 months following the initiation of chronic DBS of the SCCwm. RESULTS: Patients with TRD showed similar levels of performance to healthy controls on most neuropsychological measures, with the exception that the TRD group had slower processing speed. Patients with bipolar TRD, relative to those with unipolar TRD, obtained lower scores on measures of executive function and memory only at baseline. With acute and chronic SCCwm DBS, neuropsychological function improved in multiple domains including processing speed and executive function (planning, set shifting, response inhibition), and memory remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TRD show slowed processing speed but otherwise largely preserved neuropsychological functioning. DBS of the SCCwm does not result in worsening of any aspect of neuropsychological function and may improve certain domains.

A generalized cognitive impairment has long been understood to be a core feature of schizophrenia. More recently, it has become apparent that cognitive impairment also occurs in bipolar disorder, particularly in those patients with a history of psychotic symptoms. Whether a generalized deficit exists across a spectrum of psychotic disorders is less clearly established. Additionally, in the context of a broad impairment, it remains a significant challenge to identify deficits in specific cognitive processes that may have distinct neurochemical or regional brain substrates and linkages to particular risk-associated genetic factors. In this article, we review the findings from neuropsychological studies across a spectrum that includes schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar disorders, and conclude the available evidence strongly supports that a generalized deficit is present across psychotic disorders that differs in severity more so than form. We then consider the implications of generalized and specific deficits in psychosis for 2 areas of research--the evaluation of pharmacological treatments targeting cognitive deficits, and the investigation of cognitive intermediate phenotypes in family genetic studies. Examples from the literature that touch on the relevance of the generalized deficit in these contexts are provided, as well as consideration for the continued need to identify specific impairments that are separable from the generalized deficit in order to advance drug and gene discovery.",20140228,40,3,10.1093/schbul/sbu013,1745-1701

The aims of this work are: 1) to confirm our preliminary results in a larger sample and at a 12-month follow-up, and 2) to identify predictors of drop-out vs completion of STEPPS in order to understand which characteristics of patients make them suitable or not for this treatment. The sample is composed of 32 subjects recruited from a population of inpatients of the Mood Disorders Center, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Hospital San Raffaele-Turro, Milan. To confirm STEPPS efficacy at 12-month follow-up, we selected the following outcome criteria: reduction in the number of hospitalizations related to self-harm acts; reduction in the number of suicidal attempts; reduction of perceived emotional intensity levels; changes in cognitive filter scores; changes in the scores on self-report questionnaires. To identify predictors of drop-out vs completion, we analysed the following variables: demographic features (sex, marital status, school level achieved, and job status); Axis-I diagnosis; Axis-II categorical and dimensional diagnosis; and personality features. Seventeen (53%) subjects completed the treatment successfully. The drop-out rate was 47%. Patients who completed the program show a significant decrease in the number of hospitalizations, both at the end of the treatment and at 12-month follow-up. Friedman ANOVA test shows a significant decrease in suicidal attempts during and after STEPPS, and at 12-month follow-up.

Standard courses of pharmacotherapeutic cessation aids improve short-term abstinence, but most who attain abstinence relapse rapidly after discontinuation of pharmacotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether smokers diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disease have higher rates of prolonged tobacco abstinence with maintenance pharmacotherapy than with standard treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, relapse-prevention clinical trial conducted in 10 community mental-health centers. Of 247 smokers with schizophrenia or bipolar disease recruited from March 2008-April 2012, 203 received 12-weeks' open-label varenicline and cognitive behavioral therapy and 87 met abstinence criteria to enter the relapse prevention intervention. INTERVENTIONS: Participants who had 2 weeks or more of continuous abstinence at week 12 of open treatment were randomly assigned to receive cognitive behavioral therapy and double-blind varenicline (1 mg, 2 per day) or placebo from weeks 12 to 52. Participants then discontinued study treatment and were followed up to week 76. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seven-day rate of continuous abstinence at study week 52, the end of the relapse-prevention phase, confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide. Secondary outcomes were continuous abstinence rates for weeks 12 through 64 based on biochemically verified abstinence and weeks 12 through 76, based on self-reported smoking behavior. RESULTS: Sixty-one participants completed the relapse-prevention phase; 26 discontinued participation (7 varenicline, 19 placebo) and were considered to have relapsed for the analyses; 18 of these had relapsed prior to dropout. At week 52, point-prevalence abstinence rates were 60% in the varenicline group (24 of 40) vs 19% (9 of 47) in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR], 6.2; 95% CI, 2.2-19.2; P < .001). From weeks 12 through 64, 45% (18 of 40) among those in the varenicline group vs 15% (7 of 47) in the placebo group were continuously abstinent (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5-15.7; P = .004), and from weeks 12 through 76, 30% (12 of 40) in the varenicline group vs 11% (5 of 47) in the placebo group were continuously abstinent (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.02-13.6; P = .03). There were no significant treatment effects on psychiatric symptom ratings or psychiatric adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among smokers with serious mental illness who attained initial abstinence with standard treatment, maintenance pharmacotherapy with varenicline and cognitive behavioral therapy improved prolonged tobacco abstinence rates compared with cognitive behavioral therapy alone after 1 year of treatment and at 6 months after treatment discontinuation.

Although cognitive assessments are increasingly becoming a part of research and clinical practice in schizophrenia, a standardized and easily administered test battery for elderly patients with bipolar disorder is still lacking. The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) captures those domains of cognition that are the most severely affected in patients with schizophrenia and the most strongly correlated with functional outcome. The primary aim of our study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of the BACS in assessing cognitive functioning in elderly euthymic patients with bipolar disorder, and to compare their cognitive profile to that of elderly patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Elderly euthymic patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia were assessed using the BACS and a standard cognitive test battery. RESULTS: Fifty-seven elderly patients (aged 60 years and older) with bipolar disorder (n = 42) or schizophrenia (n = 15) were invited to participate. All of the patients were assessed by the BACS as being cognitively impaired. The patients with bipolar disorder scored significantly higher on the global scale and the verbal memory and attention sub-scores of the BACS than the patients with schizophrenia. DISCUSSION: The BACS appears to be a feasible and informative cognitive assessment tool for elderly patients with bipolar disorder. We believe that these preliminary results merit further investigation.",20140104,16,3,10.1111/bdi.12171,1399-5618

Changes in sleep pattern are frequent signs of a new episode of (hypo)mania or depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an effective treatment for primary insomnia, but there are no published results on the effects of CBT-I in patients with bipolar disorder. In this randomized controlled trial, we wish to compare CBT-I and treatment as usual with treatment as usual alone to determine its effect in improving quality of sleep, stabilizing minor mood variations and preventing new mood episodes in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and comorbid insomnia. METHODS: Patients with euthymic bipolar I or II disorder and insomnia, as verified by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID-1) assessment, will be included. The patients enter a three-week run-in phase in which they complete a sleep diary and a mood diary, are monitored for seven consecutive days with an actigraph and on two of these nights with polysomnography in addition before randomization to an eight-week treatment trial. Treatment as usual consists of pharmacological and supportive psychosocial treatment. In this trial, CBT-I will consist of sleep restriction, psychoeducation about sleep, stabilization of the circadian rhythm, and challenging and correcting sleep state misperception, in three to eight sessions. DISCUSSION: This trial could document a new treatment for insomnia in bipolar disorder with possible effects on sleep and on stability of mood. In addition, more precise information can be obtained about the character of sleep disturbance in bipolar disorder.

The assessment of selected aspects of cognitive representation of illness, i.e. acceptance of illness, health locus of control, generalized self-efficiency, hope for success, therapeutic compliance, beliefs about bipolar disorder was conducted with validated questionnaires before, after, and 18 months after receiving psychoeducation to register possible changes. RESULTS: Statistically significant increase in acceptance of illness, perceived self-efficiency, hope for success, therapeutic compliance, and positive modification of beliefs about bipolar disorder were detected. The observed change occurred right after the intervention, but it was not sustained during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Psychoeducation may exert a positive influence on virtually important cognitive variables, which seem to be clinically important.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a vehicle-treated control group (no CUS+vehicle), a VPA-treated control group (no CUS+VPA), a vehicle-treated model group (CUS+vehicle), and a VPA-treated model group (CUS+VPA). VPA (300 mg/kg once daily) was administered to rats (no CUS+VPA and CUS+VPA) by an intragastric gavage, whereas the same volume of vehicle was administered to rats in the no CUS+vehicle and CUS+vehicle groups. Rat behavior, serum corticosterone level, and expression of BDNF in the hippocampus and corticotrophin-releasing factor in the hypothalamus were determined. Compared with the CUS+vehicle rats, the CUS+VPA rats showed a significant relief in depression-like behaviors and a decrease in the corticosterone level and corticotropin-releasing factor expression with increasing expression of BDNF. The results suggest that the antidepressive effect of VPA is at least partly related to improving hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and elevating the expression of BDNF.",20131017,25,4,10.1097/WNR.0000000000000054,1473-558X

METHODS: In a prospective observational study, a total of 106 outpatients with bipolar disorder I or II were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks. Participants were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, clinical ratings of manic and depressive symptom severity, and self-reported clinical insight. Lagged correlations and linear mixed-effects models were used to determine the temporal associations between symptoms and insight, as well as the moderating influence of global cognitive abilities. RESULTS: At baseline, insight was modestly correlated with severity of manic symptoms, but not with depressive symptoms or cognitive abilities. Insight and depressive symptoms fluctuated to approximately the same extent over time. Both lagged correlations and mixed effects models with lagged effects indicated that the severity of manic symptoms predicted worse insight at later assessments, whereas the converse was not significant. There were no direct or moderating influences of global cognitive abilities. LIMITATIONS: Our sample size was modest, and included relatively psychiatrically stable outpatients, followed for a six month period.

AIMS: The aim of this research was to conduct a pilot study of a web-based parenting intervention based on the Triple P-Positive Parenting Programme. METHOD: Thirty-nine self-diagnosed bipolar parents were randomly allocated to the web-based intervention or a waiting list control condition. Parents reported on their index child (entry criterion age 4-10 years old). Perceived parenting behaviour and child behaviour problems (internalizing and externalizing) were assessed at inception and 10 weeks later (at course completion). Fifteen participants (4 control group and 11 intervention group) did not provide follow-up data. RESULTS: Levels of child behaviour problems (parent rated; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) were above clinical thresholds at baseline, and problematic perceived parenting (self-rated; Parenting Scale) was at similar levels to those in previous studies of children with clinically significant emotional and behavioural problems. Parents in the intervention group reported improvements in child behaviour problems and problematic perceived parenting compared to controls.

There is a plethora of groups, some based on one theoretical school, while others integrate theory from several 'camps'. Patients with similar diagnosis were offered different group approaches, although some trends existed. More research evidence from regular clinical groups is needed, and clinician-researcher networks should be developed.

There are different levels of resistance and different levels of evidence for this resistance. Indeed, the notions of relative and absolute resistance describe the adequacy of assigned treatment. It thus seems necessary to specify the psychopathology of treatment-resistant depression and to highlight the endogeneity phenomenon in order to solve this problem. OBJECTIVE: Our work addresses the concept of endogeneity (previously clarified by Hubertus Tellenbach) and will consider its implications in the management of treatment-resistant depression. We attempt to demonstrate that the phenomenological approach is an interesting tool in clinical practice through the highlight of endogenous characteristics. METHOD: The first step consists in specifying the endogenous phenomena: abolition of rhythms, loss of the forward-looking deployment, overall impression, and reversibility, spatial and temporal characteristics from the phenotype. Our phenomenological approach continues by exploring the false resistances. Hence, we take into account anxious comorbidity, medical comorbidity, addictions, personality disorders and the hypothesis of a bipolar diathesis. First of all, it is difficult to show the patient in which way their behaviour results in stagnation. Indeed, it could strengthen the internal move that leads to an imperious necessity to cope with the surroundings. The psychotherapeutic help is elaborated by specifically highlighting the pathogenic situations whilst also taking into account the difficulties of an authentic therapeutic alliance. RESULTS: Our approach emphasizes the endogeneity phenomenon in depression, permitting the search for an optimal therapeutic strategy. It also provides assistance in resolving false resistance or what is apparent. In cases of endogenous depression, therapeutic orientation favours pharmacological and instrumental strategies (brain stimulation). If elements of self-understanding can be given to the patient, they must show that the rigid way in which the patient appropriates the daily reports is more stressful than the choice. Therefore, the psychotherapeutic help must take into account the situation and the individual vulnerability so as to develop a suitable care.",20131002,40,2,10.1016/j.encep.2013.03.011,0013-7006

Although most treatment research has examined pharmacotherapy for pediatric BPSDs, growing literature suggests that psychosocial interventions are also important to provide families with an understanding of symptoms, course, and treatment of BPSDs; teach youth and parents methods for coping with symptoms (e.g., problem solving, communication, emotion regulation, cognitive-behavioral skills); and prevent relapse. Thirteen psychosocial intervention trials for pediatric BPSDs were identified via a comprehensive literature search and evaluated according to the Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures guidelines. All interventions were examined adjunctive to pharmacotherapy and/or treatment as usual (TAU). No well-established or questionably efficacious treatments were identified. Family psychoeducation plus skill building was probably efficacious (i.e., Multi-Family Psychoeducational Psychotherapy, Family-Focused Treatment); cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was possibly efficacious. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) were experimental. Limited research precluded subdivision of treatments by format and age. Only single- and multiple-family psychoeducation plus skill building and CBT were evaluated with children. Only single-family psychoeducation plus skill building and DBT, and individual (commonly with limited familial involvement) CBT and IPSRT were evaluated with adolescents. In conclusion, psychosocial interventions that involve families, psychoeducation, and skill building may offer added benefit to pharmacotherapy and/or other TAU.

We assessed the cognitive effects of a standardized extract of the medicinal herb Withania somnifera (WSE) in bipolar disorder. METHOD: Sixty euthymic subjects with DSM-IV bipolar disorder were enrolled in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of WSE (500 mg/d) as a procognitive agent added adjunctively to the medications being used as maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. Study enrollment and data analyses were completed between December 2008 and September 2012. Cognitive testing at baseline and 8 weeks assessed primary efficacy outcomes. Psychopathology and adverse events were monitored at scheduled visits. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients completed the study (WSE, n = 24; placebo, n = 29), and the 2 groups were matched in terms of demographic, illness, and treatment characteristics. Compared to placebo, WSE provided significant benefits for 3 cognitive tasks: digit span backward (P = .035), Flanker neutral response time (P = .033), and the social cognition response rating of the Penn Emotional Acuity Test (P = .045). The size of the WSE treatment effect for digit span backward was in the medium range (Cohen d = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.25-0.77). None of the other cognitive tasks showed significant between-group differences. Mood and anxiety scale scores remained stable, and adverse events were minor. CONCLUSIONS: Although results are preliminary, WSE appears to improve auditory-verbal working memory (digit span backward), a measure of reaction time, and a measure of social cognition in bipolar disorder. Given the paucity of data for improving cognitive capacity in bipolar disorder, WSE offers promise, appears to have a benign side-effects profile, and merits further study.

The aim of this trial is to investigate whether cognitive remediation, a new psychological treatment, improves cognitive function and, in turn, psychosocial function in patients with bipolar disorder in partial or full remission. METHODS/DESIGN: The trial has an evaluator-blind, randomized, between-groups design. Forty patients with bipolar disorder in full or partial remission, aged 18 to 50 years, who report moderate to severe cognitive difficulties, are recruited. Patients are randomized to receive weekly group-based cognitive remediation treatment over 12 weeks in addition to standard treatment or standard treatment alone. Both groups undergo neurocognitive testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline, post-treatment (week 12) and follow-up (week 26). The primary outcome is improved verbal memory, as measured with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) from baseline to post-treatment. With inclusion of 40 patients we obtain 86% power to detect a clinically relevant difference in verbal memory between groups. Secondary outcomes are improved attention, executive function and psychosocial function, as measured with the Rapid Visual Information Processing test, the Trail Making Test part B and the Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST), respectively. Tertiary outcomes are improved scores for additional neuropsychological tests of memory, attention, executive function and facial expression recognition, as well as in questionnaires measuring subjective cognitive difficulties, stress, coping strategies, personality traits, depressive symptoms and quality of life. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of cognitive remediation on cognitive function in patients with bipolar disorder who experience persistent cognitive difficulties despite being in full or partial remission.

We prospectively examined predictors of first-onset SUD among adolescents with BP. METHOD: Adolescents (12-17 years old; N = 167) in the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth (COBY) study fulfilling criteria for BP-I, BP-II, or operationalized BP not otherwise specified, without SUD at intake, were included. Baseline demographic, clinical, and family history variables, and clinical variables assessed during follow-up, were examined in relation to first-onset SUD. Participants were prospectively interviewed every 38.5 ± 22.2 weeks for an average of 4.25 ± 2.11 years. RESULTS: First-onset SUD developed among 32% of subjects, after a mean of 2.7 ± 2.0 years from intake. Lifetime alcohol experimentation at intake most robustly predicted first-onset SUD. Lifetime oppositional defiant disorder and panic disorder, family history of SUD, low family cohesiveness, and absence of antidepressant treatment at intake were also associated with increased risk of SUD, whereas BP subtype was not. Risk of SUD increased with increasing number of these 6 predictors: 54.7% of subjects with 3 or more predictors developed SUD vs. 14.1% of those with fewer than 3 predictors (hazard ratio = 5.41 95% confidence interval = 2.7-11.0 p < .0001). Greater hypo/manic symptom severity in the preceding 12 weeks predicted greater likelihood of SUD onset. Lithium exposure in the preceding 12 weeks predicted lower likelihood of SUD. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies several predictors of first-onset SUD in the COBY sample that, if replicated, may suggest targets for preventive interventions for SUD among youth with BP. Treatment-related findings are inconclusive and must be interpreted tentatively, given the limitations of observational naturalistic treatment data. There is a substantial window of opportunity between BP and SUD onset during which preventive strategies may be used.",20131001,52,10,10.1016/j.jaac.2013.07.009,1527-5418

As a result, the use of UB ECT may provide a means of further decreasing ECT-related cognitive adverse effects. In 2011, the University of Texas Southwestern Department of ECT in Austin adopted a UB ECT protocol. The purpose of this study was to perform a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of UB-RU ECT. This study also examined whether sex, age, or diagnosis affected response rates. METHODS: This retrospective chart review identified 62 patients treated with the UB ECT protocol. An analysis of ECT response rates and demographic characteristics was conducted based on the data from clinical evaluations and Patient Health Questionnaire 9. RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of patients in the study responded to ECT; 55% responded to UB pulse width RU ECT with another 13% responding when switched to standard pulse width bilateral ECT. The mean number of treatments in an index ECT series was 12.5. There was no statistically significant difference in response rates between bipolar and unipolar depressed patients. Men required progression to bilateral treatment more than women. CONCLUSIONS: This UB ECT protocol demonstrated a similar response rate when compared to standard ECT protocols; however, an increase in the number of treatments was required. Ultrabrief protocols are a viable option for both bipolar and unipolar depression. In men, UB ECT protocols may be less advantageous due to a need to overcome a potentially higher seizure threshold in men; however, additional research is needed to confirm this finding.",20131002,29,4,10.1097/YCT.0000000000000080,1533-4112

We compared EP reflecting stimulus detection and inhibition in bipolar disorder and healthy controls, and investigated relationships to impulsivity. Subjects were 48 healthy controls without family histories of mood disorder and 48 with bipolar disorder. EP were measured as latencies and amplitudes for auditory P50 (pre-attentional), N100 (initial direction of attention) and P200 (initial conscious awareness), using a paired-click paradigm, with identical stimuli 0.5 s apart. Impulsivity was measured by questionnaire and by laboratory tests for inability to suppress responses to stimuli or to delay response for a reward. Analyses used general linear models. S1 amplitudes for P50, N100, and P200, and gating of N100 and P200, were lower in bipolar disorder than in controls.

DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 51 primary care practices in three primary care districts in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 581 adults aged 18 years and older who met ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) criteria for a depressive episode on the revised Clinical Interview Schedule. We excluded acutely suicidal patients and those with psychosis, or with type I or type II bipolar disorder; patients whose low mood was associated with bereavement or whose primary presenting problem was alcohol or drug abuse; and patients receiving psychological treatment for their depression by specialist mental health services. We identified potentially eligible participants by searching computerised case records in general practices for patients with depression. INTERVENTIONS: Collaborative care, including depression education, drug management, behavioural activation, relapse prevention, and primary care liaison, was delivered by care managers. Collaborative care involved six to 12 contacts with participants over 14 weeks, supervised by mental health specialists. Usual care was family doctors' standard clinical practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression symptoms (patient health questionnaire 9; PHQ-9), anxiety (generalised anxiety disorder 7; GAD-7), and quality of life (short form 36 questionnaire; SF-36) at four and 12 months; satisfaction with service quality (client satisfaction questionnaire; CSQ-8) at four months. RESULTS: 276 participants were allocated to collaborative care and 305 allocated to usual care. At four months, mean depression score was 11.1 (standard deviation 7.3) for the collaborative care group and 12.7 (6.8) for the usual care group. After adjustment for baseline depression, mean depression score was 1.33 PHQ-9 points lower (95% confidence interval 0.35 to 2.31, P=0.009) in participants receiving collaborative care than in those receiving usual care at four months, and 1.36 points lower (0.07 to 2.64, P=0.04) at 12 months. Quality of mental health but not physical health was significantly better for collaborative care than for usual care at four months, but not 12 months. Anxiety did not differ between groups. Participants receiving collaborative care were significantly more satisfied with treatment than those receiving usual care. The number needed to treat for one patient to drop below the accepted diagnostic threshold for depression on the PHQ-9 was 8.4 immediately after treatment, and 6.5 at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative care has persistent positive effects up to 12 months after initiation of the intervention and is preferred by patients over usual care.

We hypothesized that the Life Goals Collaborative Care (LGCC) intervention, compared to enhanced usual care, would reduce CVD risk factors and improve physical and mental health outcomes in US Department of Veterans Affairs patients with bipolar disorder. METHOD: Patients with an ICD-9 diagnosis of bipolar disorder and &#8805; 1 CVD risk factor (N = 118) enrolled in the Self-Management Addressing Heart Risk Trial, conducted April 2008-May 2010, were randomized to LGCC (n = 58) or enhanced usual care (n = 60). Life Goals Collaborative Care included 4 weekly self-management sessions followed by tailored contacts combining health behavior change strategies, medical care management, registry tracking, and provider guideline support. Enhanced usual care included quarterly wellness newsletters sent during a 12-month period in addition to standard treatment. Primary outcome measures included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, nonfasting total cholesterol, and physical health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Of the 180 eligible patients identified for study participation, 134 were enrolled (74%) and 118 completed outcomes assessments (mean age = 53 years, 17% female, 5% African American). Mixed effects analyses comparing changes in 24-month outcomes among patients in LGCC (n = 57) versus enhanced usual care (n = 59) groups revealed that patients receiving LGCC had reduced systolic (ß = -3.1, P = .04) and diastolic blood pressure (ß = -2.1, P = .04) as well as reduced manic symptoms (ß = -23.9, P = .01). Life Goals Collaborative Care had no significant impact on other primary outcomes (total cholesterol and physical health-related quality of life). CONCLUSIONS: Life Goals Collaborative Care, compared to enhanced usual care, may lead to reduced CVD risk factors, notably through decreased blood pressure, as well as reduced manic symptoms, in patients with bipolar disorder.

Stimulus control and sleep restriction are powerful, clinically useful behavioral interventions for insomnia, typically delivered as part of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Both involve short-term sleep deprivation. The potential for manic or hypomanic symptoms to emerge after sleep deprivation in bipolar disorder raises questions about the appropriateness of these methods for treating insomnia. In a series of patients with bipolar disorder who underwent behavioral treatment for insomnia, the authors found that regularizing bedtimes and rise times was often sufficient to bring about improvements in sleep. Two patients in a total group of 15 patients reported mild increases in hypomanic symptoms the week following instruction on stimulus control. Total sleep time did not change for these individuals. Two of five patients who underwent sleep restriction reported mild hypomania that was unrelated to weekly sleep duration. Sleep restriction and stimulus control appear to be safe and efficacious procedures for treating insomnia in patients with bipolar disorder. Practitioners should encourage regularity in bedtimes and rise times as a first step in treatment, and carefully monitor changes in mood and daytime sleepiness throughout the intervention.",20130704,170,7,10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12050708,1535-7228

However, there is limited research evaluating this association in the context of younger patients with a broad range of mental health problems. In the present study, we evaluated social cognitive performance in 115 treatment-seeking participants who presented to a youth mental health service with affective or psychotic disturbances. Participants completed symptom severity measures, a social cognition task (the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET)), and a standardised battery of neuropsychological tests. Analyses based on diagnostic groups showed that patients with psychotic illnesses (n=23) showed impaired performance on the RMET compared to patients with primarily bipolar (n=40) and depressive illnesses (n=52). Performance on the RMET was negatively correlated with positive and negative psychotic symptoms, but not affective and anxiety symptoms. Performance on the RMET also was the strongest concurrent predictor of positive psychotic symptoms in a regression model that also included predicted intelligence, demographic variables, and neurocognition. RMET performance did not, however, predict negative symptoms above tests of sustained attention and verbal learning, nor was performance associated with any other symptoms of mental illness. Social cognitive impairments may provide a valuable marker for the presence of positive psychotic symptoms in young people with mental illness. Additionally, these impairments may have a role in the aetiology and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. Research is now needed to establish the nature of the relationship between social cognition and psychotic symptoms across different facets of social cognition. Research is also needed to investigate whether targeted social cognition treatments reduce risk for the development of positive psychotic symptoms.",20130713,149,1-3,10.1016/j.schres.2013.06.006,1573-2509

Further, it has been suggested that the degree and type of cognitive impairment differ between bipolar I and bipolar II disorder, but data is conflicting and remains inconclusive. This study aimed to clarify the suggested differences in cognitive impairment between patients with bipolar I and II disorder in a relatively large, clinically stable sample while controlling for potential confounders. METHODS: 67 patients with bipolar I disorder, 43 with bipolar II disorder, and 86 randomly selected population-based healthy controls were compared. A number of neuropsychological tests were administered, assessing verbal and visual memory and executive functions. Patients were in a stable phase during testing. RESULTS: Patients with bipolar type I and type II were cognitively impaired compared to healthy controls, but there were no statistically significant differences between the two subtypes. The strongest predictor of cognitive impairment within the patient group was current antipsychotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the type and degree of cognitive dysfunction is similar in bipolar I and II patients. Notably, treatment with antipsychotics - but not a history of psychosis - was associated with more severe cognitive impairment. Given that patients with bipolar I disorder are more likely to be on antipsychotic drugs, this might explain why some previous studies have found that patients with type I bipolar disorder are more cognitively impaired than those with type II.",20130614,13,,10.1186/1471-244X-13-165,1471-244X

METHOD: Twenty three patients with bipolar disorder underwent neuropsychological testing and functional MRI. Sixteen of these patients were tested before and after an eight-week MBCT intervention, and seven were wait listed for training and tested at the same intervals. The results were compared with 10 healthy controls. RESULTS: Prior to MBCT, bipolar patients reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and symptoms of stress, scored significantly lower on a test of working memory, and showed significant BOLD signal decrease in the medial PFC during a mindfulness task, compared to healthy controls. Following MBCT, there were significant improvements in the bipolar treatment group, in measures of mindfulness, anxiety and emotion regulation, and in tests of working memory, spatial memory and verbal fluency compared to the bipolar wait list group. BOLD signal increases were noted in the medial PFC and posterior parietal lobe, in a repeat mindfulness task. A region of interest analysis revealed strong correlation between signal changes in medial PFC and increases in mindfulness. LIMITATIONS: The small control group is a limitation in the study.

METHODS: A chart review study in adolescent psychiatric inpatients consecutively admitted over 24 months was conducted, to describe aggressive events requiring an intervention (AERI) and to characterize their management. AERIs were identified based on specific institutional event forms and/or documentation of as-needed (STAT/PRN) medication administration for aggression, both recorded by nursing staff. RESULTS: Among 408 adolescent inpatients (age: 15.2±1.6 years, 43.9% male), 1349 AERIs were recorded, with &#8805;1 AERI occurring in 28.4% (n=116; AERI+). However, the frequency of AERIs was highly skewed (median 4, range: 1-258). In a logistical regression model, the primary diagnosis at discharge of disruptive behavior disorders and bipolar disorders, history of previous inpatient treatment, length of hospitalization, and absence of a specific precipitant prior to admission were significantly associated with AERIs (R(2)=0.32; p<0.0001). The first line treatment of patients with AERIs (AERI+) was pharmacological in nature (95.6%). Seclusion or restraint (SRU) was used at least once in 59.4% of the AERI+ subgroup (i.e., in 16.9% of all patients; median within-group SRU frequency: 3). Treatment and discharge characteristics indicated a poorer prognosis in the AERI+ (discharge to residential care AERI+: 22.8%, AERI-: 5.6%, p<0.001) and a greater need for psychotropic polypharmacy (median number of psychotropic medications AERI+: 2; AERI-: 1, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high rates of pharmacological interventions, SRU continue to be used in adolescent inpatient care. As both of these approaches lack a clear evidence base, and as adolescents with clinically significant inpatient aggression have increased illness acuity/severity and service needs, structured research into the most appropriate inpatient aggression management is sorely needed.",20130508,23,4,10.1089/cap.2012.0116,1557-8992

It was nevertheless discovered that her mother had also suffered from a bipolar affective disorder. A genetic testing that followed the neurological examination of the patient proved positive for Huntington's Disease. Neuro-imaging resulted in a bicaudate-index of 2.4 (the critical value is 1.8).

Findings are inconsistent both across primary studies and previous meta-analyses. This study reanalysed 31 primary data sets as a single large sample (N = 2876) to provide a more definitive view. METHOD: Individual patient and control data were obtained from original authors for 11 measures from four common neuropsychological tests: California or Rey Verbal Learning Task (VLT), Trail Making Test (TMT), Digit Span and/or Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. RESULTS: Impairments were found for all 11 test-measures in the bipolar group after controlling for age, IQ and gender (Ps &#8804; 0.001, E.S. = 0.26-0.63). Residual mood symptoms confound this result but cannot account for the effect sizes found. Impairments also seem unrelated to drug treatment. Some test-measures were weakly correlated with illness severity measures suggesting that some impairments may track illness progression. CONCLUSION: This reanalysis supports VLT, Digit Span and TMT as robust measures of cognitive impairments in bipolar disorder patients. The heterogeneity of some test results explains previous differences in meta-analyses. Better controlling for confounds suggests deficits may be smaller than previously reported but should be tracked longitudinally across illness progression and treatment.",20130427,128,3,10.1111/acps.12133,1600-0447

Before ECT, a magnetic resonance imaging of the head was performed. Outcome predictors were investigated using multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 83 patients (mean ± SD age, 59.2 ± 15.3 years; 39% men), 28% had a psychotic depressive disorder, 16% had a bipolar depression, 30% had had previous ECT course(s), and 66% used concomitant antipsychotics. Presence of psychotic depression (ß = -0.25; P = 0.04) and having had previous ECT (ß = -0.35; P = 0.003) predicted lower post-ECT MADRS score. Baseline magnetic resonance imaging characteristics were not predictive of post-ECT MADRS and MMSE scores.

These cognitive deficits are of particular interest since they traditionally start early before the diagnosis of psychosis. They are observed during premorbid and prodromal stages, and during the first episode of psychosis. Moreover, cognitive impairments may be detected without any psychotic symptoms (such as positive symptoms) suggesting their development independently of the psychotic symptoms. Cognitive disturbances consist of impairments of episodic and working memories, intellectual functioning, executive functions (planning, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility), selective and sustained attentions and social cognition (emotion, recognition, theory of mind). The altered cognitive functions observed in schizophrenia are the same as in earlier stages but at a lower level of severity. LITERATURE FINDINGS: Data suggest that cognitive deficits can be considered as vulnerability markers of psychosis since they have been described in healthy relatives of psychotic patients with high genetic risk. Cognitive deficits might also be considered as predictive of the occurrence of the disease after the first episode of psychosis. Indeed, retrospective studies suggest cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia during premorbid and prodromal phases but not in bipolar patients. Cognitive assessment might be of particular interest in people at risk for psychosis, in order to differentiate diagnostic outcomes. Cognitive functioning impairs until the diagnosis of first episode psychosis, even though cognitive profiles are quite heterogeneous in these patients. Once the diagnosis of schizophrenia is considered, cognitive deficits may be stable, although the literature is still controversial. Several factors such as symptoms and gender can contribute in diversifying the cognitive profiles. Moreover, age of onset might worsen the prognosis because of a disruption of the cognitive development and the disturbance of scholarship in young individuals. DISCUSSION: Considering these results, the treatment of cognitive deficits should be initiated as soon as possible, e.g. in people at risk for psychosis in order to reinforce the normal cognitive development, prevent cognitive decline and to preserve the educational, professional and social status. Since antipsychotic medications do not impact on cognitive functioning, alternative therapeutics should be developed such as cognitive remediation. Several studies and meta-analyses have shown that cognitive remediation programs are particularly efficient in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorders. Contrary to antipsychotics, these techniques should be used in patients with a first psychotic episode, but also in individuals with subpsychotic symptoms, subthreshold to the diagnosis of schizophrenia.",20130327,39 Suppl 1,,10.1016/j.encep.2012.10.011,0013-7006

Optimal management of pediatric bipolar depression is often defined by its multimodal nature with emphasis on both psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatment. This article provides a brief overview of the epidemiology and clinical course of pediatric bipolar depression, a clinically-oriented guide to the evidence-based psychopharmacological and psychosocial management of bipolar depression in youth, and suggestions on how best to integrate medication and therapy. Recommended treatment for bipolar depression in pediatric populations usually includes both medication and psychosocial interventions given a paucity of double-blind, placebo-controlled psychopharmacological studies. Lithium and lamotrigine are feasible and tentatively efficacious options; however, treatment with quetiapine monotherapy may be no better than placebo. Furthermore, some youth may be at heightened risk for developing manic symptoms after treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Psychotherapy, either alone or adjunctively with medications, provides practitioners with a safe and feasible alternative.

The 10-item measure has demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including predictive accuracy and high correlations with the original 20-item version, in community populations. However, clinical utility and psychometric properties have yet to be assessed in an acutely symptomatic psychiatric population. This study examined the psychometric properties of the CES-D-10 in a sample of 755 patients enrolled in a psychiatric partial hospital program. Participants completed a diagnostic interview and a battery of self-report measures on admission and discharge. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis suggested that a one-factor structure provided a good fit to the data. High item-total correlations indicated high internal consistency, and the CES-D-10 demonstrated both convergent validity and divergent validity. Previously suggested cutoff scores of 8 and 10 resulted in good sensitivity (.91 and .89, respectively) but poor specificity (.35 and .47).

However, risks for cognitive impairment may contribute to some patients' refusal of ECT. METHODS: The present study examined galantamine as a pharmacological intervention to reduce cognitive adverse effects from ECT. Thirty-nine inpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder; bipolar disorder, depressed type; or schizoaffective disorder, depressed type and admitted for ECT were randomized to galantamine or placebo. Study drugs were initiated 24 to 48 hours before starting ECT and continued throughout the course of ECT. A neuropsychological test battery was administered at baseline and 24 to 48 hours after completing a course of ECT treatments. Depression severity was monitored using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Clinical Global Impression Scale at baseline, weekly, and end point. Self-rated adverse effects were monitored weekly. RESULTS: Thirty participants (12 patients in the galantamine group, 18 patients in the placebo group) had both pretreatment and posttreatment neuropsychological ratings. Those in the galantamine group scored significantly higher at discharge for delayed memory (t28 = 2.44, P < 0.05). Hierarchical regressions examined if treatment condition predicted changes in delayed memory scores from baseline to discharge. Inclusion of the treatment condition in the final model made a significant incremental improvement in prediction (&#916;R = 0.12, F1,27 change = 4.65, P < 0.05; ß = 0.37, t = 2.16, P < 0.05). Galantamine was well tolerated with no clinically significant bradycardia or prolonged paralysis when administered with ECT. CONCLUSIONS: Galantamine may be protective against impairment in retention of new learning. Galantamine exhibited minimal adverse effects and was safe when administered during ECT.

Lifestyle interventions require adaptation in this group because psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment are highly prevalent. Our objective was to determine the effectiveness of an 18-month tailored behavioral weight-loss intervention in adults with serious mental illness. METHODS: We recruited overweight or obese adults from 10 community psychiatric rehabilitation outpatient programs and randomly assigned them to an intervention or a control group. Participants in the intervention group received tailored group and individual weight-management sessions and group exercise sessions. Weight change was assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months. RESULTS: Of 291 participants who underwent randomization, 58.1% had schizophrenia or a schizoaffective disorder, 22.0% had bipolar disorder, and 12.0% had major depression. At baseline, the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 36.3, and the mean weight was 102.7 kg (225.9 lb). Data on weight at 18 months were obtained from 279 participants. Weight loss in the intervention group increased progressively over the 18-month study period and differed significantly from the control group at each follow-up visit. At 18 months, the mean between-group difference in weight (change in intervention group minus change in control group) was -3.2 kg (-7.0 lb, P=0.002); 37.8% of the participants in the intervention group lost 5% or more of their initial weight, as compared with 22.7% of those in the control group (P=0.009). There were no significant between-group differences in adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A behavioral weight-loss intervention significantly reduced weight over a period of 18 months in overweight and obese adults with serious mental illness. Given the epidemic of obesity and weight-related disease among persons with serious mental illness, our findings support implementation of targeted behavioral weight-loss interventions in this high-risk population.

A possible benefit of CBT could concern cognitive functions, known to be frequently impaired in patients with bipolar disorder. We analysed if the positive impact of 6 months group-CBT was associated with the improvement of a specific cognitive function, namely explicit memory, trying to disentangle if memory bias (i.e. different capacity according to the emotional valence of words to be recalled) was more improved than memory performance (i.e., total number of recalled words). METHODS: Depressive, manic, anxiety symptoms and explicit memory for emotional words were initially assessed in 68 remitted bipolar I patients. Six months later, with an attrition rate of 16.2%, patients were re-assessed after CBT (N = 42) or as control condition (waiting list, N = 15). The expected impact of CBT was assessed through the improvement in the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale. RESULTS: After CBT, an increase was observed for the number of neutral, positive and total words recalled, whereas the number of negative words recalled decreased. This increase was still significant when the improvement of dysfunctional attitudes and mood symptoms are taken into account. LIMITATIONS: The small sample of control patients. CONCLUSIONS: CBT was effective, as it improved dysfunctional attitudes and reduced remaining symptoms, but also, and independently, it improved explicit memory performance while reducing memory bias in favour of negative words.",20130305,44,3,10.1016/j.jbtep.2012.12.003,1873-7943

METHOD: One hundred depressed patients with DSM-IV-TR-defined major depressive disorder (n = 61) or bipolar disorder (n = 39), hospitalized for a 4-week psychiatric rehabilitation program, were included. Forty-five were active regular smokers, and 55 were nonsmokers who had never smoked in their lifetime. At the beginning and the end of the hospitalization, patients were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery (evaluation of verbal and visual memory, working memory, attention, visual-constructive ability, language fluency, and comprehension) as primary outcome measures and psychometric scales (evaluation of depression and illness severity). Smoking status was assessed by personal interviews. Investigators were blind to the results of neuropsychological tests and to the smoking status of the patients. Data were collected from February 2011 to January 2012. RESULTS: At the beginning of the hospitalization, smokers showed significantly better performance in verbal memory, language fluency, and working memory (all P values < .01) than nonsmokers. No interaction between smoking and diagnosis was found. At the end of the hospitalization, the whole group of patients significantly improved in several cognitive domains, with smokers maintaining significantly better performance in verbal memory, language fluency, and working memory (all P values < .01) than nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate a better performance by smokers in verbal memory and working memory domains than by nonsmokers, suggesting that a cognitive enhancement may be associated with nicotine use in depressed patients with MDD or bipolar disorder. Smoking may be a form of cognitive self-medication mediating the association between smoking and mood disorders.

The current investigation extends previous research by examining whether pretreatment outcome expectancies predict symptom change across several diagnostic categories within the context of an acute, naturalistic psychiatric setting. METHODS: Analyses were conducted to examine whether pretreatment outcome expectancies (credibility/expectancy questionnaire [CEQ]) predicted symptom improvement within major depression (N=420), bipolar disorder (N=120) and psychosis (N=36). Bootstrap mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether acquisition of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skills (cognitive behavior therapy skills questionnaire [CBTSQ]) may mediate expectancy-outcome relations. RESULTS: Results indicated a differential pattern of associations across diagnoses. Patient CBT skills emerged as a significant mediator of expectancy-outcome relations, but only in the major depression group. Both behavioral and cognitive skills were significantly, and independently, associated with symptom improvement. LIMITATIONS: Sample sizes were small in the bipolar manic subgroup and psychosis group. CBT skills and symptom measures were assessed at concurrent time points.

The current study extended these findings to young and early-course psychiatric outpatients, with the aim of identifying cognitive markers that predict later socio-occupational functioning. METHODS: At baseline, 183 young psychiatric outpatients were assessed. Ninety-three returned for follow-up (Mâ=â21.6 years old; SDâ=â4.5) with an average re-assessment interval of 21.6 months (SDâ=â7.0), and primary diagnoses of major depressive disorder (nâ=â34), bipolar disorder (nâ=â29), or psychosis (nâ=â30). The primary outcome measure was cross-validated with various other functional measures and structural equation modelling was used to map out the interrelationships between predictors and later functional outcome. RESULTS: Good socio-occupational functioning at follow-up was associated with better quality of life, less disability, current employment and being in a romantic relationship. The final structural equation model explained 47.5% of the variability in functional outcome at follow-up, with baseline neuropsychological functioning (a composite of memory, working memory and attentional switching) the best independent predictor of later functional outcome. Notably, depressive and negative symptoms were only associated with functioning cross-sectionally. Diagnosis at follow-up was not associated with functional outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychological functioning was the single best predictor of later socio-occupational outcome among young psychiatric outpatients. Therefore, framing psychiatric disorders along a neuropsychological continuum is likely to be more useful in predicting functional trajectory than traditional symptom-based classification systems. The current findings also have implications for early intervention utilising cognitive remediation approaches.",20130308,8,3,10.1371/journal.pone.0058176,1932-6203

Participants will be recruited from across the North West of England from specialist mental health services and through primary care and self referral. The primary outcome of the study is the feasibility and acceptability of AIBD assessed by recruitment to target and retention to follow-up, as well as absence of untoward incidents associated with AIBD. We will also estimate the effect size of the impact of the intervention on anxiety and mood outcomes, as well as calculate preliminary estimates of cost-effectiveness and investigate potential mechanisms for this (stigma, self appraisal and stability of social rhythms).

We aimed to prospectively explore the strength and stability of correlations between depression and mania-type symptoms and impairment in a broad range of social adjustment roles and domains. METHODS: Multilevel modeling analysis of correlation coefficients between depression and mania-type symptoms with roles and domains of the modified social adjustment scale (overall, work, social/leisure, extended family, marital, parental social adjustment roles, performance, interpersonal behavior, friction, dependency, overactivity domains) was used. Interview assessments were made at eight-week intervals beginning at eight weeks and continuing through 72 weeks after baseline in 253 patients in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: After controlling for baseline mood episodes, and other clinical, social, and treatment variables, depression symptoms showed strong and stable correlations over time with performance, overall social adjustment, and the work role; and a moderate but stable relationship with interpersonal behavior. The relationships of depression symptoms with the other roles were weak, non-significant, or not stable. For mania-type symptoms, only the correlation with interpersonal friction was moderately strong and reasonably stable over time. Mood episodes, substance use disorder, and borderline/antisocial personality disorder increased role impairment, while employment and marriage mildly decreased it.

METHODS: A total of 40 inpatients (mean age = 31.80 years, SD = 8.06; 75% males) suffering from bipolar disorders and currently in a manic state took part in the study. They were quasi-randomly assigned either to the target (continuation of sodium valproate administration) or to the control group (discontinuation of sodium valproate administration). All patients underwent bifrontal ECT for at least 6 sessions. Improvements and cognitive impairments were assessed, and seizure characteristics (duration, threshold) were also recorded. RESULTS: Manic episodes improved significantly over time, and irrespective of the group (target vs. control group). Cognitive impairments did not alter over time or between groups. Seizure duration did not change over time or between groups. Seizure threshold did not change over time, but was lower in the target than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Continuing the administration of sodium valproate neither adversely affects, nor enhances cognitive impairments or seizure duration, but reduces seizure threshold during ECT in patients suffering from manic episodes. Moreover, gender appeared to be more strongly associated with cognitive impairment and seizure activity than treatment approaches in these psychiatric conditions.",20121211,67,1,10.1159/000343490,1423-0224

The authors review the existing empirical findings, some of which may call into question current clinical pharmacotherapy practices for treating co-occurring mood and substance use disorders. The authors also highlight knowledge gaps that can serve as a basis for future research. The specific mood disorders reviewed are bipolar and major depressive disorders (either one co-occurring with a substance use disorder). Overall, findings from the relatively small amount of available data indicate that pharmacotherapy for managing mood symptoms can be effective in patients with substance dependence, although results have not been consistent across all studies. Also, in most studies, medications for managing mood symptoms did not appear to have an impact on the substance use disorder. In a recent trial for comorbid major depression and alcohol dependence, combination treatment with a medication for depression and another for alcohol dependence was found to reduce depressive symptoms and excessive drinking simultaneously. However, research has only begun to address optimal pharmacologic management of co-occurring disorders. In addition, current clinical treatment for alcohol and drug dependence often excludes new pharmacotherapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating certain types of addiction.

Method A total of 54 subjects were assessed at baseline and 6 years later; 28 had DSM-IV TR bipolar I or II disorder (recruited, at baseline, from a Lithium Clinic Program) and 26 were healthy matched controls. They were all assessed with a cognitive battery tapping into the main cognitive domains (executive function, attention, processing speed, verbal memory and visual memory) twice over a 6-year follow-up period. All patients were euthymic (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score lower than 8 and Young mania rating scale score lower than 6) for at least 3 months before both evaluations. At the end of follow-up, psychosocial functioning was also evaluated by means of the Functioning Assessment Short Test. RESULTS: Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of covariance showed that there were main effects of group in the executive domain, in the inhibition domain, in the processing speed domain, and in the verbal memory domain (p<0.04).

METHOD: A total of 255 patients underwent clinical assessments, neurocognitive testing and blood sampling. The patients were divided into groups of 'No', 'Partial' or 'Full' adherence. Relationships to different risk factors were analyzed. RESULTS: In schizophrenia, use of illicit substances, alcohol and poor insight were related to worse adherence. Schizophrenia patients with No adherence did better on tests of executive functioning, verbal learning and memory and had higher IQ than patients with better adherence. There were higher levels of autonomic side effects in the non-adherence group, but body mass index was lower in the Partial adherence group than in the Full adherence group. In the bipolar disorder patients, there was an association between the use of illicit substances and alcohol and poor adherence. We found no relationship between adherence behavior and neurocognition in the bipolar disorder group.

Indeed depressive symptomatology represents the majority of the illness burden experienced by bipolar patients and is also associated with elevated suicide risk. The treatment of bipolar depression differs from that of recurrent major depression in that the efficacy of conventional antidepressant drugs is not well-established. Some evidence-based treatments for bipolar depression are available and include the anticonvulsant drug, lamotrigine, and the atypical antipsychotic, quetiapine. Lithium also has some benefits in the prevention of depression and its use is associated with a significant reduction in suicidal behaviour. Several other treatments are in clinical development including dopamine agonists, glutamatergic modulating drugs and antioxidants. The role of these interventions in management is uncertain. The clinical uncertainties in the pharmacological treatment of bipolar depression mean that treatment has to be individualised and empirical; there is also an important role for psychological therapies, which again need to be tailored to suit the needs of the individual patient and their family.",20120821,14,,10.1007/7854_2012_209,1866-3370

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) techniques have been shown to effectively treat borderline personality disorder, a condition also marked by prominent affective disturbances. The utility of DBT techniques in treating BD has been largely unexplored. The purpose of this research was to conduct a pilot study of a DBT-based psychoeducational group (BDG) in treating euthymic, depressed, or hypomanic Bipolar I or II patients. METHODS: In this experiment, 26 adults with bipolar I or II were randomized to intervention or wait-list control groups and completed the Beck depression inventory II, mindfulness-based self-efficacy scale, and affective control scale at baseline and 12 weeks. The BDG intervention consisted of 12 weekly 90-min sessions which taught DBT skills, mindfulness techniques, and general BD psychoeducation. RESULTS: Using RM-ANOVA, subjects in BDG demonstrated a trend toward reduced depressive symptoms, and significant improvement in several MSES subscales indicating greater mindful awareness, and less fear toward and more control of emotional states (ACS). These findings were supported with a larger sample of patients who completed the BDG. Furthermore, group attendees had reduced emergency room visits and mental health related admissions in the six months following BDG. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size in RCT affects power to detect between group differences. How well improvements after the12-week BDG were maintained is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: There is preliminary evidence that DBT skills reduce depressive symptoms, improve affective control, and improve mindfulness self-efficacy in BD. Its application warrants further evaluation in larger studies.",20120804,145,3,10.1016/j.jad.2012.05.054,1573-2517

METHOD: Participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder were randomly allocated to either MBCT plus TAU or TAU alone. Primary outcome measures were time to recurrence of a DSM-IV major depressive, hypomanic or manic episode; the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Secondary outcome measures were number of recurrences, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: Ninety-five participants with bipolar disorder were recruited to the study (MBCT = 48; TAU = 47). Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis found no significant differences between the groups on either time to first recurrence of a mood episode or total number of recurrences over the 12-month period.

All received a pharmacological treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) targeted to SAD, associated with additional medications for comorbidities (mood stabilizers in 27.1%, antipsychotics in 12.8%) and 57.9% received an additional psychotherapy. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients (63.6%) responded to treatments after 3 months, namely 72.8% with psychotherapy plus medication and 50.8% with medication only. Nonresponders had more severe symptoms at baseline in terms of both clinical severity and functional impairment, and had more comorbid disruptive behavior disorders. The backward logistic regression indicated that clinical severity and functional impairment at baseline, comorbid disruptive behavior disorders, and bipolar disorders were predictors of nonresponse.

The primary objective of this trial is to establish the acceptability and feasibility of a new CBT based intervention (Recovery focused CBT; RfCBT) designed in collaboration with individuals with early bipolar disorder intended to improve clinical and personal recovery outcomes. METHODS AND DESIGN: This article describes a single blind randomised controlled trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of RfCBT compared with treatment as usual. Participants will be recruited from across the North West of England from specialist mental health services and through primary care and self referral. The primary outcome of the study is the feasibility and acceptability of RfCBT as indicated by recruitment to target and retention to follow-up as well as absence of untoward incidents associated with RfCBT. We also intend to estimate the effect size of the impact of the intervention on recovery and mood outcomes and explore potential process measures (self appraisal, stigma, hope and self esteem). DISCUSSION: This is the first trial of recovery informed CBT for early bipolar disorder and will therefore be of interest to researchers in this area as well as indicating the wider potential for evaluating approaches to the recovery informed treatment of recent onset severe mental illness in general.

It is generally accepted that NSS are prevalent in schizophrenic patients respect to healthy subjects, but they have been also found in patients with other neurological and psychiatric disorders. We sought to review studies that have specifically investigated NSS in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and we also focused on their relationship with psychopathological features and antipsychotic treatment. METHODS: In this review we selected published studies investigating NSS in psychiatric patients and their relationship with either psychopathological features and antipsychotic treatment. RESULTS: Apart from diagnosis, all patients show more NSS than healthy subjects, but schizophrenic patients perform worse respect to other psychiatric diseases. These signs are already present at the onset of the disease. NSS also show a significant correlation with psychopathological measures and they can be predictive of clinical course and response to medications. On the other hand, NSS can be independent of the pharmacological treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings argued the hypothesis that NSS could be a trait characteristic in psychosis. NSS are an objective measure for the assessment of serious psychiatric disorder in the prodromal phase, at onset and along the course of the disease.",20121120,47,6,10.1708/1178.13053,0035-6484

Notwithstanding progress in the development of pharmacological treatments for various phases of bipolar disorder, no available treatment has been proven to be reliably efficacious in treating neurocognitive deficits. Emerging evidence indicates that insulin dysregulation may be pertinent to neurocognitive function. In keeping with this view, we tested the hypothesis that intranasal insulin administration would improve measures of neurocognitive performance in euthymic adults with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Sixty-two adults with bipolar I/II disorder (based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0) were randomized to adjunctive intranasal insulin 40 IU q.i.d. (n = 34) or placebo (n = 28) for eight weeks. All subjects were prospectively verified to be euthymic on the basis of a total score of &#8804; 3 on the seven-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-7) and &#8804; 7 on the 11-item Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) for a minimum of 28 consecutive days. Neurocognitive function and outcome was assessed with a neurocognitive battery. RESULTS: There were no significant between-group differences in mean age of the subjects {i.e., mean age 40 [standard deviation (SD) = 10.15] years in the insulin and 39 [SD = 10.41] in the placebo groups, respectively}. In the insulin group, n = 27 (79.4%) had bipolar I disorder, while n = 7 (21.6%) had bipolar II disorder. In the placebo group, n = 25 (89.3%) had bipolar I disorder, while n = 3 (10.7%) had bipolar II disorder. All subjects received concomitant medications; medications remained stable during study enrollment. A significant improvement versus placebo was noted with intranasal insulin therapy on executive function (i.e., Trail Making Test-Part B). Time effects were significant for most California Verbal Learning Test indices and the Process Dissociation Task-Habit Estimate, suggesting an improved performance from baseline to endpoint with no between-group differences. Intranasal insulin was well tolerated; no subject exhibited hypoglycemia or other safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive intranasal insulin administration significantly improved a single measure of executive function in bipolar disorder. We were unable to detect between-group differences on other neurocognitive measures, with improvement noted in both groups. Subject phenotyping on the basis of pre-existing neurocognitive deficits and/or genotype [e.g., apolipoprotein E (ApoE)] may possibly identify a more responsive subgroup.",20121031,14,7,10.1111/bdi.12006,1399-5618

Current pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder target mood symptoms but have not addressed these cognitive changes resulting in euthymic individuals who still experience cognitive deficits. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) has been shown to have effects on antioxidant status, glutamate transmission, inflammation and neurogenesis. Adjunctive treatment with NAC improves the symptoms experienced by those with bipolar disorder, particularly depression, and it was hypothesized that cognition may also be improved following NAC treatment. METHODS: As part of a larger randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants in the current report were tested at baseline and 6 months to assess changes in cognitive function following either 2000 mg of NAC daily or placebo. RESULTS: This study failed to find changes in cognitive function following treatment with NAC compared to placebo.

Despite the recognized need for adjunctive psychosocial treatments in first-episode mania, very few studies have evaluated psychological interventions for this period of significant risk. In this empirical review, we evaluate existing research on first-episode bipolar disorder, compare this body of research to parallel studies of first-episode schizophrenia, and identify strategies for future research. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE and PsychINFO databases was conducted to identify studies of first-episode mania, as well as first-episode schizophrenia. Recovery and relapse rates were compared across studies. RESULTS: In contrast to a number of studies of first-episode schizophrenia, the authors identified only seven independent programs assessing first-episode mania. Findings from these studies suggest that, while pharmacological treatment helps patients achieve recovery from acute episodes, it fails to bring patients to sustained remission. Early psychosocial intervention may be imperative in reducing residual symptoms, preventing recurrence of mood episodes, and improving psychosocial functioning. However, very few studies of psychosocial interventions for first-episode mania have been systematically studied. CONCLUSIONS: Studies of first-episode mania indicate a gap between syndromal/symptomatic and functional recovery. Novel psychosocial interventions for first-episode mania may help bridge this gap, but require controlled study.",20120912,14,8,10.1111/bdi.12001,1399-5618

Given the potentially devastating nature of this prevalent disorder, there is a pressing need to improve clinical care of such patients. METHODS: We performed a literature review of the research findings related to treatment-resistant BD reported through February 2012. RESULTS: Therapeutic trials for treatment-resistant bipolar mania are uncommon, and provide few promising leads other than the use of clozapine. Far more pressing challenges are the depressive-dysthymic-dysphoric-mixed phases of BD and long-term prophylaxis. Therapeutic trials for treatment-resistant bipolar depression have assessed anticonvulsants, modern antipsychotics, glutamate [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)] antagonists, dopamine agonists, calcium-channel blockers, and thyroid hormones, as well as behavioral therapy, sleep deprivation, light therapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation, and deep brain stimulation-all of which are promising but limited in effectiveness. Several innovative pharmacological treatments (an anticholinesterase, a glutamine antagonist, a calcium-channel blocker, triiodothyronine, olanzapine and topiramate), ECT, and cognitive-behavior therapy have some support for long-term treatment of resistant BD patients, but most of trials of these treatments have been methodologically limited. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies identified were small, involved supplementation of typically complex ongoing treatments, varied in controls, randomization, and blinding, usually involved brief follow-up, and lacked replication. Clearer criteria for defining and predicting treatment resistance in BD are needed, as well as improved trial design with better controls, assessment of specific clinical subgroups, and longer follow-up.",20120904,14,6,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2012.01042.x,1399-5618

Several studies have shown that structured psychotherapy in conjunction with pharmacotherapy may modify the course of some disorders; however, few studies have investigated the results of group cognitive behavior therapy (G-CBT) for BD. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of 14 sessions of G-CBT for BD patients, comparing this intervention plus pharmacotherapy to treatment as usual (TAU; only pharmacotherapy). Forty-one patients with BD I and II participated in this study and were randomly allocated to each group (G-CBT: N = 27; TAU: N = 14). Thirty-seven participants completed the treatment (women: N = 66.67%; mean age = 41.5 years). QoL and mood symptoms were assessed in all participants. Scores changed significantly by the end of treatment in favor of the G-CBT group. The G-CBT group presented significantly better QoL in seven of the eight sub-items assessed with the Medical Outcomes Survey SF-36 scale. At the end of treatment, the G-CBT group exhibited lower scores for mania (not statistically significant) and depression (statistically significant) as well as a reduction in the frequency and duration of mood episodes (P < 0.01). The group variable was significant for the reduction of depression scores over time. This clinical change may explain the improvement in six of the eight subscales of QoL (P < 0.05).

This study tested whether the addition of ketamine reduced cognitive impairment and enhanced efficacy over a course of ECT, in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. METHODS: Fifty-one depressed patients treated with ultrabrief pulse-width right unilateral ECT were randomised to receive either ketamine (0.5mg/kg) or placebo (saline) in addition to thiopentone during anaesthesia for ECT. Neuropsychological outcomes (measured before ECT, after six treatments, and after the final ECT treatment) and mood outcomes (measured before ECT, and weekly after every three ECT treatments) were measured by a rater blinded to treatment condition. RESULTS: Neuropsychological outcomes did not differ between groups. The ECT-ketamine group had a slightly greater improvement in depressive symptoms over the first week of treatment and at one-week follow up, though there was no overall difference in efficacy at the end of the ECT course. No psychomimetic effects were detected. LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted in a clinical setting, so not all aspects of ECT treatment were fully controlled.

OBJECTIVES: To review quantitatively studies of cognitive remediation with samples that included cases of schizoaffective disorder, affective psychosis, unipolar and/or bipolar disorders. METHODS: Twenty one studies met preliminary inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 940 participants of which 35% had an affective or schizoaffective disorder. Effect sizes (ES) for pre- to post-intervention change in cognitive performance were estimated. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of 16 studies gave a pooled ES for change in cognitive function of 0.32 (95% Confidence Intervals 0.20 to 0.43) and produced statistical homogeneity. Overall, ES were significantly positively correlated with higher proportion of schizo-affective and affective cases (r=0.61; p=0.007), even when age, gender and duration of therapy were included as covariates in the analysis (r=.59, p=0.017). LIMITATIONS: The quality of and small number of affective disorder only studies mean the findings must be treated with caution. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated ES reflect those reported in the literature on cognitive remediation for schizophrenia. As such a conservative interpretation is that cognitive remediation has at least equivalent benefits in affective and schizo-affective disorder as demonstrated in schizophrenia.

METHODS: We examined the longer-term efficacy of 600 mg/day of mifepristone as an adjunctive treatment, for 1 week, in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial in 60 patients with bipolar depression, with SWM as the primary outcome measure. A comparator group of healthy control subjects was also recruited. RESULTS: At baseline, neuropsychological performance of patients was impaired, but hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function did not differ from that of control subjects. Mifepristone treatment was associated with a time-limited increase in cortisol awakening response and with a sustained improvement in SWM performance, which was evident 7 weeks after the cessation of treatment. The magnitude of this neuropsychological response was predicted by the magnitude of the cortisol response to mifepristone. The response occurred in the absence of a significant improvement in depressed mood. CONCLUSIONS: These data accord with the findings of animal studies and demonstrate that brief treatment with mifepristone is associated with a sustained improvement in SWM, an effect that might be mediated by a persistent enhancement in hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor function.",20120710,72,11,10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.05.029,1873-2402

Few studies have compared these psychosocial treatments, all of which are lengthy, expensive, and difficult to disseminate. We compared the relative effectiveness of a brief psychoeducation group intervention to a more comprehensive and longer individual cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention, measuring longitudinal outcome in mood burden in bipolar disorder. METHOD: This single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted between June 2002 and September 2006. A total of 204 participants (ages 18-64 years) with DSM-IV bipolar disorder type I or II participated from 4 Canadian academic centers. Subjects were recruited via advertisements or physician referral when well or minimally symptomatic, with few exclusionary criteria to enhance generalizability. Participants were assigned to receive either 20 individual sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy or 6 sessions of group psychoeducation. The primary outcome of symptom course and morbidity was assessed prospectively over 72 weeks using the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation, which yields depression and mania symptom burden scores for each week. RESULTS: Both treatments had similar outcomes with respect to reduction of symptom burden and the likelihood of relapse. Eight percent of subjects dropped out prior to receiving psychoeducation, while 64% were treatment completers; rates were similar for cognitive-behavioral therapy (6% and 66%, respectively). Psychoeducation cost $180 per subject compared to cognitive-behavioral therapy at $1,200 per subject. CONCLUSIONS: Despite longer treatment duration and individualized treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy did not show a significantly greater clinical benefit compared to group psychoeducation. Psychoeducation is less expensive to provide and requires less clinician training to deliver, suggesting its comparative attractiveness.

METHODS: An extensive literature search identified item scores from mania rating scales, with a particular emphasis on baseline Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) item scores in published double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of bipolar I manic disorder. These baseline YMRS item scores were assessed as a proportion of the total YMRS score and compared by age group. Additional YMRS item/total scores in subjects with bipolar spectrum disorders were added to expand the analysis. RESULTS: Preadolescents with bipolar disorder had significantly higher YMRS item scores than adolescents on aggression, irritability, and motor activity. Young Mania Rating Scale baseline item scores relative to the YMRS total score revealed that adolescents diagnosed with bipolar I mania scored comparatively higher than did adults on YMRS aggression and irritability items, whereas adults with bipolar I manic disorder scored comparatively higher on the grandiosity and sexual interest items. Age-grouped findings from subjects diagnosed with bipolar I, II, and Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) disorders yielded similar age-grouped results. CONCLUSION: In age-grouped YMRS item assessments of bipolar mania, anger dyscontrol was most prominent for youth, whereas disordered thought content was paramount for adults.",20120612,53,8,10.1016/j.comppsych.2012.04.011,1532-8384

Several studies have shown that structured psychotherapy in conjunction with pharmacotherapy may modify the course of some disorders; however, few studies have investigated the results of group cognitive behavior therapy (G-CBT) for BD. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of 14 sessions of G-CBT for BD patients, comparing this intervention plus pharmacotherapy to treatment as usual (TAU; only pharmacotherapy). Forty-one patients with BD I and II participated in this study and were randomly allocated to each group (G-CBT: N = 27; TAU: N = 14). Thirty-seven participants completed the treatment (women: N = 66.67%; mean age = 41.5 years). QoL and mood symptoms were assessed in all participants. Scores changed significantly by the end of treatment in favor of the G-CBT group. The G-CBT group presented significantly better QoL in seven of the eight sub-items assessed with the Medical Outcomes Survey SF-36 scale. At the end of treatment, the G-CBT group exhibited lower scores for mania (not statistically significant) and depression (statistically significant) as well as a reduction in the frequency and duration of mood episodes (P < 0.01). The group variable was significant for the reduction of depression scores over time. This clinical change may explain the improvement in six of the eight subscales of QoL (P < 0.05). The G-CBT group showed better QoL in absolute values in all aspects and significant improvements in nearly all subscales. These results were not observed in the TAU control group.",20120628,45,9,,1414-431X

A systematic MEDLINE search was made concerning the treatment of BP (RCTs) with the names of treatment options as keywords. The search was updated on 10 March 2012. The literature suggests that lithium, first and second generation antipsychotics and valproate and carbamazepine are efficacious in the treatment of acute mania. Quetiapine and the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination are also efficacious for treating bipolar depression. Antidepressants should only be used in combination with an antimanic agent, because they can induce switching to mania/hypomania/mixed states/rapid cycling when utilized as monotherapy. Lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine and aripiprazole are efficacious during the maintenance phase. Lamotrigine is efficacious in the prevention of depression, and it remains to be clarified whether it is also efficacious for mania. There is some evidence on the efficacy of psychosocial interventions as an adjunctive treatment to medication. Electroconvulsive therapy is an option for refractory patients. In acute manic patients who are partial responders to lithium/valproate/carbamazepine, adding an antipsychotic is a reasonable choice. The combination with best data in acute bipolar depression is lithium plus lamotrigine. Patients stabilized on combination treatment might do worse if shifted to monotherapy during maintenance, and patients could benefit with add-on treatment with olanzapine, valproate, an antidepressant, or lamotrigine, depending on the index acute phase. A variety of treatment options for BP are available today, but still unmet needs are huge. Combination therapy may improve the treatment outcome but it also carries more side-effect burden. Further research is necessary as well as the development of better guidelines and algorithms for the step-by-step rational treatment.",20120525,262 Suppl 1,,10.1007/s00406-012-0323-x,1433-8491

Both of those processes appear relevant to symptom generation. Hence, bipolar disorder seems related to a greater emphasis on reaching goals and also a problematic reactivity to reaching those highly desired goals.

Here, we review the most recent findings about these two presentations and discuss the approaches to their treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Longitudinal and genetic findings suggest that chronic irritability should be regarded as a mood problem that is distinct from bipolar disorder. A proportion of children with short (less than 4 days) episodes of mania-like symptoms seem to progress to classical (Type I or II) bipolar disorder over time in the US clinic samples. In a UK sample, such episodes were independently associated with psychosocial impairment. The evidence base for the treatment of either irritability or short-lived episodes of mania-like symptoms is still small. Clinicians should be cautious with extrapolating treatments from classical bipolar disorder to these mood regulation problems. Cognitive and behavioural therapy (CBT)-based approaches targeting general mood regulation processes may be effective for cases with severe irritability or short episodes of mania-like symptoms. SUMMARY: There is increasing research evidence for the importance of mood regulation problems in the form of either irritability or short episodes of mania-like symptoms in youth. The evidence base for their drug treatment has yet to be developed. CBT-based interventions to modify the processes of mood regulation may be a useful and well tolerated intervention for patients with these presentations.",20120510,25,4,10.1097/YCO.0b013e3283534982,1473-6578

Mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a - event-related potentials associated with auditory preattentional processing - have been extensively studied in schizophrenia, but rarely in bipolar disorder. Furthermore, MMN and P3a have not been examined between diagnostic subgroups of patients with bipolar disorder. We evaluated MMN and P3a in patients with bipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. METHODS: MMN and P3a were assessed in 52 bipolar disorder patients, 30 schizophrenia patients, and 27 healthy control subjects during a duration-deviant auditory oddball paradigm. RESULTS: Significant MMN and P3a amplitude reductions were present in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia relative to controls. The MMN reduction was more prominent in patients with schizophrenia than bipolar disorder, at a trend level. P3a did not differ significantly between patient groups. There were no MMN or P3a differences between patients with bipolar I (n = 34) and bipolar II (n = 18) disorder. Patients with bipolar I disorder failed to show lateralized MMN, in contrast to the other groups. No MMN or P3a differences were found between patients with bipolar disorder taking (n = 12) and not taking (n = 40) lithium, as well as between those taking (n = 30) and not taking (n = 22) antipsychotic medications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with bipolar disorder showed deficits in preattentive auditory processing, including MMN deficits that are less severe and P3a deficits that are slightly more pronounced, than those seen in schizophrenia.",20120503,14,3,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2012.01008.x,1399-5618

Customized adherence enhancement (CAE) is a needs-based, manualized approach intended to improve medication adherence in individuals with BD. This was a six-month prospective trial of a CAE among 43 medication non-adherent individuals with BD who were receiving treatment in a community mental health clinic (CMHC). METHODS: CAE was flexibly administered in modules applied as indicated by an initial adherence vulnerabilities screening. Screening identified reasons for non-adherence and modules were then administered using pre-set criteria. CAE effects were evaluated at six-week, three-month, and six-month follow-up. The six-month follow-up was our primary time point of interest. The primary outcome was change from baseline in adherence using the Tablets Routine Questionnaire (TRQ) and pill counts. Secondary outcomes included change from baseline in BD symptoms [Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)]. RESULTS: Subjects completed 86% of scheduled sessions, with only two individuals (5%) not participating in any sessions. The number of dropouts at six months was 12 (28%). Mean baseline non-adherence by TRQ was 48% [standard error (SE) 4.8%] missed tablets within the previous week and 51% (4.1%) missed tablets within the previous month. At six-month follow-up, mean TRQ non-adherence improved to 25% (6.8%) missed tablets for the previous week (p = 0.002) and 21% (5.5%) for the previous month (p < 0.001). Symptoms improved, with a change in the baseline mean (SE) BPRS of 43.6 (1.8) versus an endpoint of 36.1 (2.3) (p = 0.001), and baseline mean (SE) HAM-D of 17.8 (1.1) versus an endpoint of 15.3 (1.6) (p = 0.044). CONCLUSION: CAE was associated with improvements in adherence, symptoms, and functional status. Controlled trials are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",20120503,14,3,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2012.01010.x,1399-5618

METHODS: Secondary analysis of a multisite, 12-week, open-label, uncontrolled study of add-on lamotrigine in 57 adults 60 years and older with BD I or II depression. Measures included the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Cardiometabolic risk was measured with total serum cholesterol and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G) item #13 (endocrine/metabolic burden). Neurocognitive (executive) function was evaluated using the Trail Making Test. RESULTS: Greater reduction in MADRS from baseline was associated with higher baseline cardiometabolic burden at 6 and 9 weeks and lower YMRS scores at 9 weeks. At 12 weeks, improvement in the MADRS from baseline was no longer significantly related to baseline cardiometabolic burden or YMRS scores. A longitudinal mixed model of MADRS scores corroborated these findings with a significant finding of time-by-baseline cholesterol level interaction. In a subset of participants, better baseline executive function was related to greater improvement in the MADRS at 9 weeks but not at 6 or 12 weeks. Among all participants, higher baseline YMRS scores were related to greater likelihood of dropout. CONCLUSIONS: Lamotrigine appears to work best in depressed elderly patients with BD who have high cardiometabolic risk and low level of mania. Agents like lamotrigine that act primarily on neuroprogressive pathways involving oxidative stress, neurotrophins, and inflammation may be particularly effective in individuals with BD who have significant cardiometabolic burden because of their effects on shared vulnerability factors in BD and medical illness.",20120403,25,1,10.1177/0891988712436685,0891-9887

We compared participants recruited from inpatient versus outpatient settings in regard to the patients' predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics. RESULTS: Being treated in an inpatient rather than an outpatient setting was associated with the predisposing characteristic of being non-Hispanic caucasian (odds ratio [OR]: 0.1; P = .005) and past history of treatment with first-generation antipsychotics (OR: 6.5; P < .001), and the need characteristic reflected in having psychotic symptoms present in the current episode (OR: 126.08; P < .001).

Parental mood and activity was assessed by self-report questionnaires (CES-D, ISS, MDQ and SRM); parenting was assessed using the Parenting Scale (PS). The SDQ was used to assess the parent's view of their child's emotional and behavioural difficulties. The Confusion, Hubbub and Order Scale (CHAOS) assessed household organization. RESULTS: Parents reported high levels of difficulties across all measures and scores were above clinical cut-offs on most scales. Children were reported as showing high levels of disturbance on the SDQ, including all sub-scales.

We describe the design, rationale, and baseline findings for the Self-Management Addressing Heart Risk Trial (SMAHRT), a randomized controlled effectiveness trial of an intervention (Life Goals Collaborative Care; LGCC) designed to reduce CVD risk factors and improve physical and mental health outcomes in patients with BD. METHODS: Patients with BD and at least one CVD risk factor were recruited from a VA healthcare system and randomized to either LGCC or usual care (UC). LGCC participants attended four weekly, group-based self-management sessions followed by monthly individual contacts supportive of health behavior change and ongoing medical care management. In contrast, UC participants received monthly wellness newsletters. Physiological and questionnaire assessments measured changes in CVD outcomes and quality of life (QOL) over 24 months. RESULTS: Out of the 180 eligible patients, 134 patients were enrolled (74%) and 118 started the study protocols. At baseline (mean age=54, 17% female, 5% African American) participants had a high burden of clinical risk with nearly 70% reporting at least three CVD risk factors including, smoking (41%) and physical inactivity (57%).

Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy combines mindfulness meditation, a form of attentional training, along with aspects of cognitive therapy, and may improve attentional dysfunction in bipolar disorder patients. METHODS: 12 euthymic BD patients and 9 control participants underwent record of electroencephalography (EEG, band frequency analysis) during resting states (eyes open, eyes closed) and during the completion of a continuous performance task (A-X version, EEG event-related potential (ERP) wave component analysis). The individuals with BD completed an 8-week MBCT intervention and record of EEG was repeated. RESULTS: (1) Brain activity, individuals with BD showed significantly decreased theta band power, increased beta band power, and decreased theta/beta ratios during the resting state, eyes closed, for frontal and cingulate cortices. Post MBCT intervention improvement over the right frontal cortex was seen in the individuals with BD, as beta band power decreased. (2) Brain activation, individuals with BD showed a significant P300-like wave form over the frontal cortex during the cue. Post MBCT intervention the P300-like waveform was significantly attenuated over the frontal cortex.

The purpose of this study was to investigate for the first time the similarities and differences in the cognitive function of older adults with BD and MDD that may shed light on mechanisms of cognitive decline. METHODS: A total of 165 subjects with BD (n = 43) or MDD (n = 122), ages &#8805; 65 years [mean (SD) 74.2 (6.2)], were assessed when euthymic, using comprehensive measures of cognitive function and cognitive-instrumental activities of daily living (C-IADLs). Test results were standardized using a group of mentally healthy individuals (n = 92) of comparable age and education level. RESULTS: Subjects with BD and MDD were impaired across all cognitive domains compared with controls, most prominently in Information Processing Speed/Executive Function. Despite the protective effects of having higher education and lower vascular burden, BD subjects were more impaired across all cognitive domains compared with MDD subjects. Subjects with BD and MDD did not differ significantly in C-IADLs. CONCLUSION: In older age, patients with BD have worse overall cognitive function than patients with MDD.

METHODS: Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) using the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) through 72 weeks from intake. RESULTS: 3 classes were identified: (1) little change in symptomatic status (NO), comprising 24.9% of participants, with a 72-week remission rate of 25.3%; (2) slow, steady improvement (SLOW), comprising 47.9% of participants, with a remission rate of 60.0%, and (3) rapid symptom response (GO), comprising 27.2% of participants, with a remission rate of 85.7%. Higher baseline CDRS-R (p<0.001) and poorer functioning (p=0.03) were the strongest discriminators between NO and GO. Higher baseline CDRS (p<0.001) and scores on the Mania Rating Scale (MRS) (p=0.01) were the strongest discriminators between SLOW and GO. Other variables differentiating GO from both NO and from SLOW, were better baseline functioning, lower hopelessness, and lower family conflict. Both NO and SLOW showed increases on the MRS over time compared to GO (ps &#8804; 0.04), and increasing MRS was strongly associated with lack of remission by 72 weeks (p=0.02). LIMITATIONS: High rate of open treatment by the end of the follow-up period creates difficulty in drawing clear inferences about the long-term impact of initial randomization. CONCLUSION: Along with depressive severity, sub-syndromal manic symptoms, at baseline, and over time emerged as important predictors and correlates of poor outcome in this sample.

METHODS: A sample of 40 patients was divided into 2 groups: (1) combined drug plus psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioral treatment or (2) drug treatment only (control group). We used a multigroup design with repeated measures at different times (baseline, posttreatment, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up) to evaluate the following variables: age, sex, number of hospitalizations, type of treatment, mania (Young Mania Rating Scale, or YMRS) and depression (Beck Depression Index, or BDI) symptoms, subsyndromal symptoms (BDI >7; YMRS >6), global suffering index, general index of social ability, self-esteem (Rosenberg scale), inadaptation (inadaptation Scale), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), quality of life (Global Activity Functioning), and health (European Quality of Life Scale). We considered favorable prognosis for subjects without persistent affective symptoms (BDI <7; YMRS <6) and/or without relevant difficulties in adaptation (Inadaptation Scale <14) in a 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: A binary logistic regression showed that the type of treatment (combined therapy corresponded to better progression), the number of prior hospitalizations (fewer hospitalizations corresponded to better progression), and self-esteem (higher self-esteem corresponded to better prognosis) were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The type of treatment, the number of prior hospitalizations, and the level of self-esteem were the most influencing factors for a favorable progression of refractory bipolar disorder.

Modern studies have reported rates between 50 and 68% for those symptoms which refer to subsyndromal manifestations present between affective episodes but that do not meet the required criteria for episodes definition. These manifestations comprise residual symptoms, prodromes, axis I comorbid psychiatric disorders, side effects of treatment, temperamental features, and comorbidity with personality disorders. Inter- episodes symptoms represent a risk factor for the occurrence of relapses and recurrences and are usually associated with impairments in functioning in almost all domains of psychosocial and family life. As they are easy to miss, it is important in clinical practice, to draw the attention of clinicians, patients and relatives to the role they have in the course of the illness. As far as their management, it may be crucial to achieve a full remission of the episodes, using adequate dosages of psychotropic drugs.

Targeting some of them with specific psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions could reduce the consequences of their expression and so have an action on the course of the disease and also preventive.",20130103,38 Suppl 3,,10.1016/S0013-7006(12)70088-X,0013-7006

We evaluated the effects of the dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist pramipexole on cognition in bipolar disorder. METHOD: Fifty stable outpatients with DSM-IV-diagnosed bipolar I or bipolar II disorder enrolled in an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cognitive enhancement trial between July 2006 and April 2010. Patients completed neurocognitive testing at baseline and at week 8, and the primary outcome measures were change scores calculated for each of the 11 tasks. Symptoms and side effects were monitored weekly. RESULTS: Forty-five patients completed the study (placebo, n = 24; pramipexole, n = 21), and groups were well matched on demographic and clinical features. Primary cognitive analyses indicated no compelling cognitive benefit of pramipexole versus placebo; however, secondary analyses highlight several important methodological issues for future trials and identify a subgroup of patients who might benefit more readily from cognitive enhancement strategies. This outcome suggests that the study design played a very important role in the results-implying a failed rather than altogether negative trial. Specifically, we found that even very subtle, subsyndromal mood symptoms at baseline had a significant influence on the degree of improvement due to active drug, with strictly euthymic patients faring best (multivariate analysis of variance, P = .03 in euthymic subgroup). In addition, the extent of baseline cognitive impairment also contributed to the likelihood of treatment response. Finally, concomitant medications may weaken, or in some cases enhance, response to cognitive treatment and should be accounted for in study design. CONCLUSIONS: Although our results point toward a lack of clear effect of pramipexole on cognition in bipolar patients, our data revealed a potentially beneficial effect of pramipexole in a subgroup, providing some enthusiasm for pursuing this line of research in the future. Moreover, this study emphasizes the importance of rigorous subject selection for cognitive trials in bipolar illness. Future studies will be necessary to determine the possible clinical and functional implications of these results.

We examined neural circuitry supporting emotion regulation in females with either BDd or UDd as a first stage toward identifying biomarkers that may differentiate BDd from UDd. METHOD: Fifty-seven females aged 18-45 years participated in this study: 23 with UDd, 18 with bipolar disorder type I depression (BDId) and 16 healthy females. During 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the participants performed an emotional face n-back (EFNBACK) task, that is an n-back task with high (2-back) and low (0-back) memory load conditions flanked by two positive, negative or neutral face distracters. This paradigm examines executive control with emotional distracters-emotion regulation. RESULTS: High memory load with neutral face distracters elicited greater bilateral and left dorsal anterior midcingulate cortex (dAMCC) activity in UDd than in healthy and BDId females respectively, and greater bilateral putamen activity in both depressed groups versus healthy females. High memory load with happy face distracters elicited greater left putamen activity in UDd than in healthy females. Psychotropic medication was associated with greater putamen activity to these contrasts in UDd females. CONCLUSIONS: During high memory load with neutral face distracters, elevated dAMCC activity in UDd suggests abnormal recruitment of attentional control circuitry to maintain task performance, whereas elevated putamen activity unrelated to psychotropic medication in BDId females may suggest an attentional bias toward ambiguous neutral face distracters. Differential patterns of functional abnormalities in neural circuitry supporting attentional control during emotion regulation, especially in the dAMCC, is a promising neuroimaging measure to distinguish UDd from BDId in females.",20111122,42,7,10.1017/S003329171100242X,1469-8978

However, these studies compared CBT to either a waiting list control group, brief psycho-education or treatment as usual (TAU). Our primary aim was to determine whether CBT is superior to supportive therapy (ST) of equal intensity and frequency in preventing relapse and improving outcome at post-treatment. A secondary aim was to look at predictors of survival time. METHOD: We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at the Department of Psychology, University of Tübingen, Germany (n=76 patients with BD). Both CBT and ST consisted of 20 sessions over 9 months. Patients were followed up for a further 24 months. RESULTS: Although changes over time were observed in some variables, they were not differentially associated with CBT or ST. CBT showed a non-significant trend for preventing any affective, specifically depressive episode during the time of therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses revealed that 64.5% of patients experienced a relapse during the 33 months. The number of prior episodes, the number of therapy sessions and the type of BD predicted survival time. CONCLUSIONS: No differences in relapse rates between treatment conditions were observed, suggesting that certain shared characteristics (e.g. information, systematic mood monitoring) might explain the effects of psychosocial treatment for BD.

Adult separation anxiety has been found to predict poorer response to CBT, but its effect on response to medication has not been previously explored. STUDY AIM: The aim of this study is to investigate if panic-agoraphobic spectrum factors, including 'separation anxiety' factor predict treatment outcome in patients with panic disorder. STUDY SAMPLE: Participants who met criteria for PD (n=57) completed baseline assessment and 12 months follow-up. Patients were administered the Panic Agoraphobic Spectrum Self-Report (PAS-SR, Lifetime and Last-Month Versions), and the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). We examined patients who met the following criteria at baseline: 1) PDSS total score>7; 2) no current Axis I comorbidity with major depression; 3) no lifetime or current bipolar disorder. All patients were treated with evidence-based psychopharmacological treatment for panic disorder during the 12-month observation period. RESULTS: Twenty eight patients (48.1%) achieved remission during the follow-up period. In a logistic regression model, controlling for baseline severity, gender and age, only the last-month PAS-SR 'separation anxiety' factor was associated with a lower likelihood of remission. CONCLUSIONS: Signs and symptoms of separation anxiety in adulthood, as assessed with the PAS-SR Last Month version, are predictors of poor treatment outcome in patients with PD. We submit that the assessment of panic-agoraphobic spectrum features, including adult separation anxiety, should become routine of clinical assessment of patients with PD.

Following a baseline clinical assessment, 12 individuals with DSM-IV bipolar disorder were treated with 12 group sessions of MBCT. RESULTS: At the end of treatment, as well as at the 3 months follow-up, participants showed increased mindfulness, lower residual depressive mood symptoms, less attentional difficulties, and increased emotion-regulation abilities, psychological well-being, positive affect, and psychosocial functioning.

Extraoperative invasive cortical stimulation can show some areas critical to language, but not all of them, due to scarce sampling, poor cooperation, cortical immaturity, or network reorganization, whereas functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) displays entire networks involved in, but not necessarily critical to, language. In a homogeneous series of children with epilepsy, we compared the contributions of language fMRI and depth electrode stimulations to optimize language mapping. METHODS: Eight children (7.5-15.5 years) with left frontal or temporal epilepsy underwent language fMRI and language stimulation with depth electrodes as part of their comprehensive presurgical workup. fMRI data collected during sentence generation were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM2) (false discovery rate [FDR] p < 0.05). Bipolar stimulations were performed during language production tasks. By coregistering fMRI and postimplantation computed tomography (CT) images, we were able to directly compare the cortical areas identified by both investigations. KEY FINDINGS: fMRI during sentence generation robustly showed activation in the whole perisylvian regions with little reorganization (left hemisphere dominant in 7). Of the 184 electrode contacts tested for language, only 8 were positive (language disruption) in three of the seven patients with periictal language impairment and left language dominance. All of the positive contacts colocalized with an fMRI activated cluster, that is, fMRI did not miss any region critical to language (sensitivity = 100%). However, 54 of the 176 negative contacts were within activated clusters (low specificity). SIGNIFICANCE: In children with epilepsy, the sensitivity of fMRI during sentence generation allows for the detection of all critical regions displayed by cortical stimulation within the large perisylvian language network, but with a low specificity. It is, therefore, useful to optimize the placement of intracranial electrodes when language mapping is necessary. Systematic planning of the electrode placement according to language fMRI maps should increase the yield of extraoperative cortical stimulation, which appears rather low in children when compared to adults.",20111201,53,1,10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03329.x,1528-1167

Nevertheless, whether neuropsychological profiles differ three main subtypes of mood disorder (Bipolar I, Bipolar II and UP) remain understudied because most current studies include either mixed samples of bipolar I and bipolar II patients or mixed samples of different states of the illness. The main aim of the present study is to determine whether, or to some extent, specific cognitive domains could differentiate the main subtypes of mood disorders in the depressed and clinically remitted status. METHOD: Three groups of bipolar I (n=92), bipolar II (n=131) and unipolar depression (UP) patients (n=293) were tested with a battery of neuropsychological tests both at baseline (during a depressive episode) and after 6 weeks of treatment, contrasting with 202 healthy controls on cognitive performance. The cognitive domains include processing speed, attention, memory, verbal fluency and executive function. RESULTS: At the acute depressive state, the three patient groups (bipolar I, bipolar II and UP) showed cognitive dysfunction in processing speed, memory, verbal fluency and executive function but not in attention compared with controls. Post comparisons revealed that bipolar I depressed patients performed significantly worse in verbal fluency and executive function than bipolar II and UP depressed patients. No difference was found between bipolar II and UP depressed patients except for the visual memory. After 6 weeks of treatment, clinically remitted bipolar I and bipolar II patients only displayed cognitive impairment in processing speed and visual memory. Remitted UP patients showed cognitive impairment in executive function in addition to processing speed and visual memory. The three remitted patient groups scored similarly in processing speed and visual memory. LIMITATION: Clinically remitted patients were just recovered from a major depressive episode after 6 weeks of treatment and in relatively unstable state. CONCLUSION: Bipolar I, bipolar II and UP patients have a similar pattern of cognitive impairment during the state of acute depressive episode, but bipolar I patients experience greater impairment than bipolar II and UP patients. In clinical remission, both bipolar and UP patients show cognitive deficits in processing speed and visual memory, and executive dysfunction might be a status-maker for bipolar disorder, but a trait-marker for UP.",20111216,136,3,10.1016/j.jad.2011.11.029,1573-2517

The current study examines co-morbid DBD and aggression prospectively as predictors of pharmacotherapy outcome, as well as potential moderators of response to a specific medication (risperidone vs. divalproex), among children with PBD. METHODS: Data are from a prospective 6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized outpatient medication treatment trial of risperidone versus divalproex for manic episodes in 65 children 8-18 with PBD. Outcome measures were administered at pretest, post-test, and weekly during the 6 weeks of treatment. Mixed-effects regression models were used to examine pharmacotherapy response. RESULTS: Results indicated that youth with co-morbid DBD experienced greater improvement in manic symptoms in response to risperidone versus divalproex, whereas youth with non-co-morbid DBD experienced similar trajectories of symptom improvement in both medication groups. In addition, the non-DBD group experienced greater improvement in global functioning over time as compared with youth with co-morbid-DBD, and this gap increased over the course of treatment. Results also indicated that high-aggression youth experienced worse global functioning by end treatment versus low-aggression youth. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a co-morbid diagnosis of DBD and/or high levels of aggressive symptoms in youth with PBD may be important clinical predictors of variation in treatment response to pharmacotherapy.

The purpose of this study was to assess changes in self-reported cognitive functioning in patients with bipolar disorder who participated in an open pilot trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Following MBCT, patients reported significant improvements in executive functioning, memory, and ability to initiate and complete tasks, as measured by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe).

CASE SUMMARY: A 10-year-old male with a history of developmental stuttering, bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and conduct disorder was admitted to the psychiatric hospital because of recurrent suicidal ideations and increased physical aggression toward staff at his residential facility. The patient was being treated with lithium at initial dose of 150 mg/day at bedtime for bipolar disorder NOS. When the lithium dose was increased to 900 mg twice daily to better control the bipolar symptoms, his developmental stutter worsened intensely. When the lithium dose was reduced to 600 mg in the morning and 900 mg at night, the stutter returned to baseline. No other medication changes were made during this interval. His serum lithium concentration was 0.62 mEq/L at baseline, 1.24 mEq/L during the height of his exacerbated stutter, and returned to 0.64 mEq/L after dose reduction. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, only 1 case of lithium-exacerbated stutter has been reported in the literature, and this was in an adult. The developmental stutter of our pediatric patient worsened when he was treated with higher doses of lithium. He was on stable doses of his other medications during the adjustments to the lithium dose, making it less likely that the stutter was due to one of these medications. However, it is possible that the exacerbation involved an interaction between lithium and one or several of the other medications. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, this case represents a probable adverse drug reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that an additional adverse effect of lithium may be an exacerbation of stutter.",20110916,45,10,10.1345/aph.1Q140,1542-6270

The intervention reported combines motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioural therapy to address ambivalence and equips individuals with strategies to address substance use. Across five individual case studies, preliminary evidence is reported to support the acceptability and the feasibility of this approach. Despite most participants not highlighting their substance use as a primary therapy target, all but one exhibited reduced use of drugs or alcohol at the end of therapy, sustained at 6 months' follow-up.

METHOD: Participants included 67 adult inpatients and outpatients aged 18-60 years meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder (bipolar I and II disorders, bipolar disorder not otherwise specified). We assessed demographic factors, mood symptoms, psychosis, trauma history, trait impulsivity, trait aggression, and reasons for living. The primary outcome measures were the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-version II, Aggression Questionnaire, and 10 cognitive outcome variables. The cognitive outcome variables assessed cognitive performance across several domains, including processing speed, attention, verbal learning, and executive function. Another aspect of cognitive function, decision making, was assessed using the Iowa Gambling Task. The study was conducted from July 2007-July 2009. RESULTS: We found that nonattempters reported significantly higher trait impulsivity scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale compared to attempters (t(57) = 2.2, P = .03) and that, among attempters, lower trait impulsivity score was associated with higher scores of lethality of prior attempts (r(25) = -0.53, P = .01). Analyses revealed no other group differences on demographic, clinical, or neurocognitive variables when comparing attempters versus nonattempters. Regression models failed to identify any significant predictors of past suicide attempt. CONCLUSIONS: The largely negative results of our study are particularly important in highlighting the clinical dilemma faced by many clinicians when trying to predict which patients will make serious suicide attempts and which patients are at a lower risk for acting on suicidal thoughts. A limitation of our work is that we examined stable trait measures of impulsivity among a euthymic sample rather than mood state or the impact of mood state on traits. Overall, we conclude that suicidal behavior is extremely difficult to predict, even when comprehensive clinical and neurocognitive information is available.",20110805,72,8,10.4088/JCP.10m06410,1555-2101

However, VSWM performances may depend on basic neurocognitive processes and are possibly compromised by neurocognitive effects of psychotropic medications. METHODS: A total of 32 remitted BPD patients and 39 healthy controls undertook parametric VSWM tasks and assessments for selective attention, sustained attention, psychomotor speed, mental flexibility, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III full IQ. Using a multivariate model and trend analysis and controlling for other basic neurocognitive ability, the effects of mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, GABAergic agonists, and anticholinergics on VSWM performances were explored by post-hoc analysis comparing performances across WM loads between healthy controls and patients treated and not treated with a specific medication. RESULTS: Remitted BPD patients showed more pronounced performance declines in VSWM performances as WM loads increased, indicating inefficient VSWM processing. The VSWM deficits of remitted patients were independent of their impairments in attentional processes or psychomotor speed. Among the medications, only GABAergic agonists were associated with impaired VSWM performances. CONCLUSIONS: Remitted BPD patients had WM-load-dependent VSWM processing deficits after controlling for neurocognitive performances. As these deficits were associated with the use of GABAergic agonists, altered GABAergic neurotransmission might be involved with the underlying mechanisms of the impaired VSWM processing of BPD. Since GABAergic agonist use is often continued from the acute to the remitted phase in BPD and might potentially affect the functional recovery, clinicians should be aware of these neurocognitive side effects, even at low dosages. Close monitoring and timely discontinuation of GABAergic agonists is of utmost importance for clinical practice.",20110817,13,4,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2011.00931.x,1399-5618

Accordingly, psychopharmacologic treatments have been increasingly utilized in severely ill youth. However, the increased use of psychopharmacologic treatments in pediatric patients has also raised concerns regarding a potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment of youth, without adequate data regarding the pediatric efficacy and safety of psychotropic agents. Over the past decade, a remarkable number of pediatric randomized controlled trials have been completed, especially with psychostimulants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. For these frequently used agents, effect sizes against placebo have typically been at least moderate, with most numbers-needed-to-treat well below 10 for response, indicating clinical significance as well. Nevertheless, data also point to a greater and/or different profile of susceptibility to adverse effects in pediatric compared to adult patients, as well as to a role for nonpharmacologic treatments, given alone or combined with pharmacotherapy, for many of the youth. Taken together, these results highlight the need for a careful assessment of the risk-benefit relationship of psychopharmacologic treatments in patients who cannot be managed sufficiently with nonpharmacologic interventions and for routine, proactive adverse effect monitoring and management. Although considerable progress has been made, there is still enormous need for additional data and funding of pediatric psychopharmacology trials.

In both cases, there is a remarkable lack of consensus amongst professionals concerning its operative definition. A relatively wide variety of treatment options for unipolar TRD are available, whilst the evidence is very scanty for bipolar TRD. TRD is associated to poor clinical, functional, and social outcomes. Several novel therapeutic options are currently being investigated as promising alternatives, targeting the neurotransmitter system outside of the standard monoamine hypothesis. Augmentation or combination with lithium or atypical antipsychotics appears as a valid option for both conditions, and the same occurs with electroconvulsive therapy.

Analyses examined the relationship of demographic variables, diagnoses, impairment, and comorbidity with type and level of services utilized. RESULTS: Utilization was multimodal; half the youths had received outpatient and school services during their lifetime. Factors unrelated to need (age, sex, race, and insurance) were associated with service type. Children with a bipolar spectrum disorder had higher use of inpatient services than those with depressive or disruptive disorders and were more likely to currently use two or more services. More than half of youths with bipolar or depressive disorders had lifetime use of both medication and therapy, whereas youths with a disruptive behavior disorder were more likely to have used only therapy. Impairment and comorbidity were not related to service utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Use of services began at a very young age and occurred in multiple service sectors. Type of service used was related to insurance and race, underscoring the need for ongoing disparities research.

METHOD: Forty-one patients with bipolar I and II disorder participated in the study and were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups; thirty-seven patients remained in the study until its completion. Mood and anxiety symptoms were measured in all subjects. Statistical analysis was used to investigate if the groups differed with respect to demographic characteristics and the scores recorded in the pre- and post-treatment stages, as well as during treatment (intra/inter groups). RESULTS: Patients showed statistically similar population characteristics. The association of cognitive behavioral group therapy and pharmacological treatment proved to be effective. Patients who had undergone cognitive behavioral group therapy presented fewer symptoms of mania, depression and anxiety, as well as fewer and shorter mood change episodes. CONCLUSION: Cognitive behavioral group therapy sessions substantially contributed to the improvement of depression symptoms.",20110825,33,2,10.1590/S1516-44462011000200009,1516-4446

First-episode psychosis (FEP) patients show reduced amplitudes of the 'MMN/P3a complex', but it is unclear whether this occurs across the FEP spectrum. METHODS: Fifty-three young people (17-36 years) were assessed: 17 FEP affective-spectrum (bipolar disorder with psychotic features and major depressive disorder with psychotic features), 18 FEP schizophrenia-spectrum (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophreniform disorder), and 18 healthy controls. MMN/P3a was acquired during a two-tone, auditory paradigm with 8% duration deviants. Clinical, psychosocial and neuropsychological assessments were also undertaken. RESULTS: FEP schizophrenia- and FEP affective-spectrum showed significantly reduced fronto-central MMN and central P3a amplitudes compared to controls. FEP subgroups also showed significantly poorer cognitive and psychosocial functioning. The combined FEP sample showed significant correlations between fronto-central MMN amplitudes and cognitive measures. DISCUSSION: FEP schizophrenia-spectrum and FEP affective-spectrum were similarly impaired in two biomarkers for schizophrenia. FEP subgroups showed impairments in fronto-central MMN consistent with chronic patients. Similarly, both subgroups showed reductions in P3a; although the affective subgroup showed an 'intermediate' frontal response. These findings suggest that FEP patients with both affective and schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses share common neurobiological disturbances in deviance detection/orienting processes in the early phase of illness.",20110510,130,1-3,10.1016/j.schres.2011.03.025,1573-2509

We investigated relationships among impulsivity, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) or borderline personality disorder symptoms, substance use disorder, course of illness, and history of criminal behavior in bipolar disorder. METHODS: A total of 112 subjects with bipolar disorder were recruited from the community. Diagnosis was by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I and SCID-II); psychiatric symptom assessment by the Change version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS-C); severity of Axis II symptoms by ASPD and borderline personality disorder SCID-II symptoms; and impulsivity by questionnaire and response inhibition measures. RESULTS: A total of 29 subjects self-reported histories of criminal conviction. Compared to other subjects, those with convictions had more ASPD symptoms, less education, more substance use disorder, more suicide attempt history, and a more recurrent course with propensity toward mania. They had increased impulsivity as reflected by impaired response inhibition, but did not differ in questionnaire-measured impulsivity. On logit analysis, impaired response inhibition and ASPD symptoms, but not substance use disorder, were significantly associated with criminal history. Subjects convicted for violent crimes were not more impulsive than those convicted for nonviolent crimes. CONCLUSIONS: In this community sample, a self-reported history of criminal behavior is related to ASPD symptoms, a recurrent and predominately manic course of illness, and impaired response inhibition in bipolar disorder, independent of current clinical state.",20110330,13,2,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2011.00900.x,1399-5618

METHODS: A randomized controlled single-blind trial was conducted with 50 patients with bipolar disorder types I and II followed up for at least 12 months in an outpatient service and whose disease was in remission. An experimental CBGT manual was developed and added to treatment as usual (TAU), and results were compared with TAU alone. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed that there was no difference between groups in terms of time until any relapse (Wilcoxon = 0.667; p = 0.414). When considering type of relapse, there was still no difference in either depressive (Wilcoxon = 3.328; p = 0.068) or manic episodes (Wilcoxon = 1.498; p = 0.221). Although occurrence of episodes also did not differ between groups (&#967;(2) = 0.28; p = 0.59), median time to relapse was longer for patients treated with CBGT compared to TAU (Mann-Whitney = -2.554; p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Time to recurrence and number of episodes were not different in the group of patients treated with CBGT. However, median time to relapse was shorter in the TAU group.

AIMS: To test the feasibility, acceptability and patient-rated effectiveness of G-CBT for HAPIs in which patients' themselves choose the group therapeutic targets, within a previously rarely used sole-standalone session format. METHOD: Weekly G-CBT was run for two HAPI wards. The G-CBT was evaluated in terms of attendances/re-attendances, and patient feedback on 5-point scales of how strongly patients agreed/disagreed that the group was useful, enjoyable, worth re-attending, and had led to them learning something they could use to reduce their distress. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-seven separate patients attended a total of 291 times across 31 groups. Being female or having a diagnosis of bipolar disorder significantly predicted re-attendance. Sixty-three percent of patient feedback questionnaires were obtained from groups 10-31 and over 75% of respondents agreed positively with each of the evaluation dimensions.

The effect of pharmacologic treatment on cognition is still uncertain because of an insufficient number of studies examining this issue. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to compare neuropsychologic performance of treated bipolar patients with that of controls, including unmedicated patients and healthy subjects, as well as to evaluate possible neurocognitive differences among 3 different atypical antipsychotics. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 119 subjects were included in the study. Of 79 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition euthymic bipolar patients, 68 were treated with one atypical antipsychotic, quetiapine (n = 12), olanzapine (n = 26), or risperidone (n = 30). Sixteen patients were drug-free. The 4 groups were compared with a sample of drug-naïve patients and a healthy control group (n = 35) on several clinical and neuropsychologic variables, especially on the domains of attention, verbal memory, and executive functions. Euthymia was defined by a score of 6 or less at the Young Mania Rating Scale and a score of 8 or less at the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale for at least 6 months. RESULTS: The 5 groups did not differ in age, years of education, sex distribution, or estimated premorbid IQ. The 4 patients groups did not differ in chronicity, age of onset, total number of episodes, and number of hospitalizations. No differences were found regarding antipsychotic dosages between the groups. Bipolar patients performed poorly on most neuropsychologic measures as compared with healthy controls. After controlling for Hamilton Depression Rating Scale symptoms, no significant change in the results was observed. Because many patients with antipsychotic treatment had a history of psychotic symptoms, we performed multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for this variable. Bipolar patients taking 1 of the 3 antipsychotics presented with dose-independent significant deficits in most cognitive tasks compared with healthy controls. After several head-to-head group comparisons, the patients receiving quetiapine showed a better performance in learning task, short-term memory, and recognition task assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test and verbal fluency (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the findings of previous studies of cognitive deficits in bipolar disorder. Untreated euthymic patients showed better cognitive performance than did patients on atypical antipsychotics. Some iatrogenic-pharmacologic effect, therefore, cannot be excluded, but quetiapine seemed to be less associated with impairment in measures of verbal memory than olanzapine or risperidone. We suggest to use drugs in bipolar disorder with a lower risk of cognitive adverse effects. However, randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to give a definite answer to this critical problem.",20110208,52,6,10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.12.009,1532-8384

DATA SOURCES: A literature search from 1950 to week 1 of August 2009 was conducted via OVID and the National Institutes of Health's clinical trials online databases. Search terms included anxiety, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and treatment. Reference lists of identified articles were also searched. STUDY SELECTION: Fourteen treatment studies that included patients with bipolar disorder with either a syndrome-defined anxiety disorder or nonspecific anxiety were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Sample size, bipolar disorder subtype, comorbid anxiety disorders, baseline anxiety, treatment interventions, and outcome measurements were extracted. RESULTS: The majority of studies focus on treating anxiety disorders and nonspecific anxiety occurring during bipolar mood episodes. Studies of syndrome-defined anxiety disorders reveal that risperidone monotherapy did not separate from placebo and that olanzapine was superior to lamotrigine when used to augment lithium treatment. A study using open-label divalproex sodium and an uncontrolled study of group cognitive-behavioral therapy both suggest some benefit from these treatments in patients with bipolar disorder with panic disorder. Studies of nonspecific anxiety reveal some benefit for divalproex, quetiapine, olanzapine, and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination. Weaker evidence supports the use of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, and observational studies suggest potential efficacy for gabapentin and valproate. CONCLUSIONS: Nonspecific anxiety symptoms occurring during a mood episode improve with treatment of the mood disturbance, though divalproex may be the mood stabilizer of choice for anxious patients with bipolar disorder. Given their reduced risk for manic induction and episode cycling, psychotherapy, benzodiazepines, and certain atypical antipsychotics are recommended for treatment of anxiety disorders present in patients with bipolar disorder not currently experiencing an acute mood episode.",20110107,72,1,10.4088/JCP.09r05815gre,1555-2101

Research into BD has been driven by a strongly medical model conception, with a focus upon pathology and dysfunction. Little research to date has focused upon strategies used to maintain or regain wellness in BD. Here, we present results from a qualitative study of self-management strategies used by a Canadian sample of 'high-functioning' individuals with BD. The aims of the present paper are two-fold: (1) To provide a description of the self-management strategies identified as effective by this sample of high functioning individuals and 2) to explore these results from a clinical perspective. METHODS: High functioning (determined as a score of either 1 or 2 on the objectively-rated Multidimensional Scale of Independent Functioning) individuals with BD type I or II (N = 33) completed quantitative scales to assess depression, mania, psychosocial functioning and quality of life, and underwent either an individual interview or focus group about the self-management strategies they used to maintain or regain wellness. RESULTS: The specific self-management strategies that individuals enacted are contained within the following categories: (1) sleep, diet, rest and exercise; (2) ongoing monitoring; (3) reflective and meditative practices; (4) understanding BD and educating others; (5) connecting to others and (6) enacting a plan. These strategies are discussed in the context of current treatment interventions and research findings, offering clinicians a broad range of potential techniques or tools to assist with their efforts to support individuals with BD in maintaining or regaining wellness. CONCLUSIONS: The strategies adopted by a sample of people coping well with their BD show remarkable overlap with the targets of existing adjunctive psychosocial interventions for BD. The clinician can use this information to motivate clients to engage with such strategies. The present findings also serve to remind the clinician of significant individual differences in the personal meaning and concrete application of superficially similar strategies.",20100624,18,2,10.1002/cpp.710,1099-0879

Several studies showed that high-dosage right unilateral ECT (RULECT) had a better antidepressant effects than low-dosage RULECT and less cognitive side effect than bilateral stimulation. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, we examined the efficacy and cognitive side effects of RULECT with three different (high dose) stimulus intensities (4×, 7× and 10× above the seizure threshold (ST)). METHODS: 41 patients with treatment resistant unipolar or bipolar depression were randomized to one of the three stimulation intensities. For stimulation, we used an ultrabrief pulse (0.3 ms). Primary outcome measures were reduction of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the response rate (50% reduction of the HDRS) in the three groups. For cognitive side effects, a neuropsychological test battery was assessed. RESULTS: All three groups responded significantly to 9 ECTs (p < 0.005), but there were no statistical significant differences in the response rates between the three intensity groups. Besides of the Verbal Learning Memory Recognition Test (VLMT), which showed significant impairments in the high dose intensity groups, no differences could be shown between the three study groups in all neuropsychological tests. CONCLUSION: A RULECT with ultrabrief pulse stimulation and 4× ST intensity is effective and from good tolerability.

The pharmacological treatment of anxiety can interact with the bipolar disorder and has not been proven effective. As such, many have recommended the psychological treatment of anxiety. This paper reviews the literature on psychological treatments for anxiety comorbid to bipolar disorder. METHOD: The Medline, PsychInfo and Web of Science databases were thoroughly examined for relevant treatment studies. RESULTS: Despite frequent recommendations in the literature, surprisingly few have studied the psychological treatment of comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorders. Nevertheless, preliminary results suggest that comorbid anxiety disorders can be effectively treated in a bipolar clientele using cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral therapy or relaxation training. In contrast, interpersonal, family therapy and psychoeducation alone would not seem to be beneficial treatment alternatives for anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral therapy appears to reduce the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and general symptoms of anxiety among patients with bipolar disorder. However, the long-term maintenance of anxiety treatment effects may be somewhat reduced and adaptations may be called for to augment and sustain benefits. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need for randomized controlled trials of different forms of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders comorbid to bipolar disorder. Until such trials are available, the most promising approach would appear to be the sequential or modular CBT-based treatment of the anxiety disorder.",20101125,133,3,10.1016/j.jad.2010.10.040,1573-2517

CONCLUSIONS: ADHD and ODD have both shared and unique genetic influences. Persistence of ADHD and ODD in adolescence is linked with an increased risk of delinquent behaviour, substance dependence, anxiety, depression, and possibly bipolar disorder. The diagnostic work up for ADHD must include screening for ODD, which may be achieved through targeted questioning or the use of standard symptom checklists. Treatment requires management of the core symptoms of ADHD plus, in many cases, augmentation with other treatment to address the ODD. Mild cases may respond to behaviour management alone, or monotherapy with stimulant medication or atomoxetine. Moderate to severe cases usually require a combination of pharmacotherapy, which may include clonidine, and behaviour management. Severe or refractory cases may require the introduction of an atypical antipsychotic such as risperidone.",20101202,18,6,10.3109/10398562.2010.498049,1440-1665

Moreover, no approved therapies for various phases of BD have been shown to reliably improve any dimension of neurocognitive performance. In this article, we emphasize that aerobic physical exercise is a viable neurocognitive-enhancing adjunctive treatment for patients with BD. The overarching aim of this review is to emphasize that aerobic physical exercise is a viable neurocognitive-enhancing adjunctive treatment for patients with BD. METHODS: We conducted PubMed and Google Scholar searches of all English-language articles published between January 1966 and February 2010 using the search terms bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, depression, exercise, and physical activity cross-referenced with each other and the following terms: cognition, executive function, learning, memory, attention, emotion, and behavior. Articles selected for review were based on adequacy of sample size, use of standardized experimental procedures, validated assessment measures, and overall quality. RESULTS: Available studies have documented an array of persisting neurocognitive deficits across disparate bipolar populations. Abnormalities in verbal working memory are highly replicated; deficits in executive function, learning, attention, and processing speed are also a consistent abnormality. The effect sizes of neurocognitive deficits in BD are intermediate between those reported in schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. Several original reports and reviews have documented the neurocognitive-enhancing effects of aerobic exercise in the general population as well as across diverse medical populations and ages. Proposed mechanisms involve nonexclusive effects on neurogenesis, neurotrophism, immunoinflammatory systems, insulin sensitivity, and neurotransmitter systems.

METHOD: Healthy controls (HC) (n=14; mean age =14.1 ± 2.4 years) and unmedicated PBD patients with manic or hypomanic episodes (n=17; mean age =14.3 ± 1.1 years) were matched on intelligence quotient (IQ) and demographic factors. The fMRI studies were performed at baseline and after 14 weeks, during which PBD patients were treated initially with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) followed by lamotrigine monotherapy. The pediatric affective color-matching task was used where subjects matched the color of a positive, negative, or neutral word with one of the two colored circles below in each of the trials. There were five blocks of each emotional word type, with 10 trials per block. RESULTS: Behavioral data showed that the PBD group was modestly slower and less accurate than the HC, regardless of condition or treatment status. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal activity was reduced with treatment in the PBD group relative to the HC group during the negative versus neutral condition in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), right posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule, but increased in left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Similarly, during the positive versus neutral condition, the PBD group, relative to HC, showed reduced activity in right DLPFC, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule and increased activity in the right VMPFC. However, within the PBD group, there was treatment related decrease in VMPFC and DLPFC. Improvement on Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score significantly correlated with the decreased activity in VMPFC within the patient group. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacotherapy in PBD patients led to differential effort with persistently increased activity in the affective regions and decreased activity in the cognitive regions relative to HC, demonstrating altered mechanisms of affective and cognitive systems of brain function, regardless of symptom response.",20101027,20,5,10.1089/cap.2009.0105,1557-8992

Drug treatments for these affective disorders have insufficient clinical effects in a large group and fail to reverse cognitive deficits. There is thus a need for more effective treatments which aid cognitive function. Erythropoietin (Epo) is involved in neuroplasticity and is a candidate for future treatment of affective disorders. The investigators have demonstrated that a single dose of Epo improves cognitive function and reduces neurocognitive processing of negative emotional information in healthy and depressed individuals similar to effects seen with conventional antidepressants. The current study adds to the previous findings by investigating whether repeated Epo administration has antidepressant effects in patients with treatment resistant depression and reverses cognitive impairments in these patients and in patients with bipolar disorder in remission. METHODS/DESIGN: The trial has a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. 40 patients with treatment-resistant major depression and 40 patients with bipolar disorder in remission are recruited and randomised to receive weekly infusions of Epo (Eprex; 40,000 IU) or saline (NaCl 0.9%) for 8 weeks. Randomisation is stratified for age and gender. The primary outcome parameters for the two studies are: depression severity measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 items (HDRS-17) 1 in study 1 and, in study 2, verbal memory measured with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) 23.

We present preliminary efficacy data from a novel variation of Family Focused Treatment [Miklowitz DJ. Bipolar Disorder: A Family-Focused Treatment Approach (2(nd) ed.). New York: The Guilford Press, 2008] that aimed to reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder by working with caregivers to enhance illness management skills and self-care. METHODS: The primary family caregivers of 46 patients with bipolar I (n = 40) or II (n = 6) disorder, diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, were assigned randomly to receive either: (i) a 12-15-session family-focused, cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to provide the caregiver with skills for managing the relative's illness, attaining self-care goals, and reducing strain, depression, and health risk behavior [Family-Focused Treatment-Health Promoting Intervention (FFT-HPI)]; or (ii) an 8- to 12-session health education (HE) intervention delivered via videotapes. We assessed patients pre- and post-treatment on levels of depression and mania and caregivers on levels of burden, health behavior, and coping. RESULTS: Randomization to FFT-HPI was associated with significant decreases in caregiver depressive symptoms and health risk behavior. Greater reductions in depressive symptoms among patients were also observed in the FFT-HPI group. Reduction in patients' depression was partially mediated by reductions in caregivers' depression levels. Decreases in caregivers' depression were partially mediated by reductions in caregivers' levels of avoidance coping. CONCLUSIONS: Families coping with bipolar disorder may benefit from family interventions as a result of changes in the caregivers' ability to manage stress and regulate their moods, even when the patient is not available for treatment.",20100928,12,6,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2010.00852.x,1399-5618

Significant differences in attention and executive function were found between patients and controls and in those patients who had had just 1 manic episode compared to those who had 3 or more.

RESULTS: Adolescents meeting criteria for mania, externalizing disorders (oppositional defiant, conduct, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders), or comorbid for externalizing and internalizing disorders (major depressive, generalized anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorders) were significantly more likely to report a lifetime history of vaginal or anal sex than those who did not meet criteria for any psychiatric disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0, 2.3, and 1.9, respectively).

There was no cortical thinning in bipolar disorder compared with control subjects or in schizophrenia compared with bipolar disorder. However, the subgroup of patients with bipolar disorder Type 1 showed cortical thinning, primarily in the frontal lobes and superior temporal and temporoparietal regions.

An increased relative glucose metabolic rate (rGMR) in patients with a diagnosis of PG had previously been reported in the medial and orbitofrontal cortex. We extended our studies to include functional alterations of the striatum and thalamus in a cohort of patients with PG before and after treatment with lithium. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with PG who met lifetime comorbid bipolar spectrum diagnoses and a comparison group of 21 age- and sex-matched controls underwent a baseline positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Sixteen of these patients entered a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group-design trial of lithium and underwent a follow-up PET scan at week 10. Anatomical MRI were obtained and the structures outlined on consecutive axial slices. These individual hand-drawn templates were used to identify structures on the PET scan of each patient, and the rGMR was measured. RESULTS: The PG patients had a decrement of the rGMR in the ventral parts of the striatum and thalamus, and an increment of the rGMR in the dorsal parts as compared with the controls. Lithium treatment increased the ventral caudate rGMR to a trend level in the patients, but had no effect on the metabolism of either the putamen or the thalamus. CONCLUSION: Because of their extensive connectivity to the frontal cortex, striatal and thalamic functional alteration may contribute to faulty decision making processes in PG patients. By increasing the ventral rGMR of the caudate nucleus, lithium treatment may reduce cognitive dysfunction and symptoms in PG patients.",20100701,62,2,10.1159/000317286,1423-0224

MBCT has been mostly evaluated with remitted unipolar depressed patients and little is known about this treatment in bipolar disorder. METHODS: Bipolar outpatients (type I, II and NOS) were included and evaluated for depressive and hypomanic symptoms, as well as mindfulness skills before and after MBCT. Patients' expectations before the program, perceived benefit after completion and frequency of mindfulness practice were also recorded. RESULTS: Of 23 included patients, 15 attended at least four MBCT sessions. Most participants reported having durably, moderately to very much benefited from the program, although mindfulness practice decreased over time. Whereas no significant increase of mindfulness skills was detected during the trial, change of mindfulness skills was significantly associated with change of depressive symptoms between pre- and post-MBCT assessments. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT is feasible and well perceived among bipolar patients.

METHOD: Seventy-four outpatients with a major depressive episode treated with an adequate antidepressant dosage for at least 4 weeks were included in our study and randomly assigned to two different groups: HFL or LFR rTMS. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) items were pooled into 6 factors to evaluate specific symptoms as possible predictors of response. RESULTS: Twenty-one out of 32 patients (65.6%) and 24 out of 42 patients (57.1%) were responders in the HFL and LFR groups, respectively. No significant difference in response rate was observed. Considering the whole sample, we found an inverse correlation between activity and HAM-D score reduction and a significant positive relation between somatic anxiety and outcome. An inverse correlation between psychic anxiety and HAM-D score reduction emerged considering the HFL group. In the LFR group, there was a significant negative relationship between baseline activity and the outcome.

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is a pleomorphic condition, with varying manifestations that are determined by a number of complex factors including the stage of illness. It is consequently a notoriously difficult illness to diagnose and as a corollary is associated with lengthy delays in recognition and the initiation of suitable treatment. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE augmented by a manual search. RESULTS: Emerging neuroimaging data suggests that, in contrast to schizophrenia, where at the time of a first-episode of illness there is already discernible volume loss, in bipolar disorder, gross brain structure is relatively preserved, and it is only with recurrences that there is a sequential, but marked loss of brain volume. Recent evidence suggests that both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are more effective if instituted early in the course of bipolar disorder, and that with multiple episodes and disease progression there is a noticeable decline in treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Such data supports the notion of clinical staging, and the tailored implementation of treatments according to the stage of illness. The progressive nature of bipolar disorder further supports the concept that the first episode is a period that requires energetic broad-based treatment, with the hope that this could alter the temporal trajectory of the illness. It also raises hope that prompt treatment may be neuroprotective and that this perhaps attenuates or even prevents the neurostructural and neurocognitive changes seen to emerge with chronicity. This highlights the need for early identification at a population level and the necessity of implementing treatments and services at a stage of the illness where prognosis is optimal.",20100504,19,2,10.3109/09638230903469111,1360-0567

The purpose of this study was to determine whether neuropsychological impairments are present in clinically stable patients with bipolar disorder shortly after resolution of their first manic episode. METHOD: Within a large university medical center, 45 recently diagnosed (DSM-IV-TR) patients with bipolar disorder type I were evaluated after resolution of their first manic episode, along with 25 matched healthy comparison subjects. Participants were administered a neuropsychological battery evaluating 5 broad cognitive domains, including verbal/premorbid intellectual functioning, learning/memory, spatial/nonverbal reasoning, attention/processing speed, and executive function. Data were collected from July 2004 to August 2007. RESULTS: Relative to controls, patients showed broad impairments in learning/memory, spatial/nonverbal reasoning, executive function, and some aspects of attention (all P < .01). Specifically, deficits were evident on tests assessing sustained attention, attentional and mental set shifting, spatial working memory, nonverbal reasoning, and verbal learning and recall (all P < .01). Cognitive impairments in patients could not be fully attributed to substance abuse, medication status, or residual mood symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that core neuropsychological deficits in sustained attention, learning and recall, spatial/nonverbal reasoning, and several aspects of executive function are present at illness onset. Cognitive deficits in bipolar disorder are, thus, most likely not exclusively attributable to progressive decline associated with increased illness burden, cumulative treatment effects, or chronicity of illness.

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is associated with significant psychosocial impairment and high use of mental health services. Generally medication is effective in the treatment of acute episodes but there is increasing evidence that while a large majority of patients recover from these episodes of mania and/or depression, many do not achieve a functional recovery. In response a range of psychotherapies have either been adapted or developed. DESIGN: An extensive review of the literature was performed using Medline, Cinahl and PsycINFO databases and 35 relevant research studies were chosen that met inclusion criteria. FINDINGS: All the identified psychosocial interventions were structured, adhered to manualized protocols and had solid evidence demonstrating their effectiveness when used as an adjunct to psychopharmacology. The identified psychosocial interventions all incorporated some features of a psycho-education including developing an acceptance of the disorder, awareness of its prodromes and signs of relapse, and communication with others; and several emphasise regular sleep and activity habits. CONCLUSION: Mental health nurses have an important role to play in integrating psychosocial interventions into their clinical practice settings and in conducting high quality trials of their clinical effectiveness. Nurses are well-positioned to lead pragmatic trials of the clinical effectiveness of these psychosocial interventions in mental health services because of their experience and expertise in working with patients with bipolar disorder.",20100318,47,7,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.02.012,1873-491X

METHOD: This multicentre randomised, double-blind, controlled trial (NCT00069407) was carried out from 2001 to 2006. A total of 230 individuals with major depression, bipolar and unipolar, were randomly assigned to one of three electrode placements during a course of ECT: bifrontal at one and a half times seizure threshold, bitemporal at one and a half times seizure threshold and right unilateral at six times seizure threshold. RESULTS: All three electrode placements resulted in both clinically and statistically significant antidepressant outcomes. Remission rates were 55% (95% CI 43-66%) with right unilateral, 61% with bifrontal (95% CI 50-71%) and 64% (95% CI 53-75%) with bitemporal. Bitemporal resulted in a more rapid decline in symptom ratings over the early course of treatment. Cognitive data revealed few differences between the electrode placements on a variety of neuropsychological instruments. CONCLUSIONS: Each electrode placement is a very effective antidepressant treatment when given with appropriate electrical dosing. Bitemporal leads to more rapid symptom reduction and should be considered the preferred placement for urgent clinical situations.

The effects of the commonly used antidepressants in bipolar depression are questionable. Electroconvulsive therapy is generally considered to be the most effective treatment even if there are no randomized controlled trials of electroconvulsive therapy in bipolar depression. The safety of electroconvulsive therapy is well documented, but there are some controversies as to the cognitive side effects. The aim of this study is to compare the effects and side effects of electroconvulsive therapy to pharmacological treatment in treatment resistant bipolar depression. Cognitive changes and quality of life during the treatment will be assessed. METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective, randomised controlled, multi-centre six- week acute treatment trial with seven clinical assessments. Follow up visit at 26 weeks or until remission (max 52 weeks). A neuropsychological test battery designed to be sensitive to changes in cognitive function will be used. SETTING: Nine study centres across Norway, all acute psychiatric departments. SAMPLE: n = 132 patients, aged 18 and over, who fulfil criteria for treatment resistant depression in bipolar disorder, Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale Score of at least 25 at baseline. INTERVENTION: INTERVENTION group: 3 sessions per week for up to 6 weeks, total up to 18 sessions. CONTROL GROUP: algorithm-based pharmacological treatment as usual. DISCUSSION: This study is the first randomized controlled trial that aims to investigate whether electroconvulsive therapy is better than pharmacological treatment as usual in treatment resistant bipolar depression. Possible long lasting cognitive side effects will be evaluated. The study is investigator initiated, without support from industry.

We assessed patients with bipolar disorder undergoing a hospital admission early in the illness course and identified predictors of occupational status, overall social adjustment, and work adjustment six months later. METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study. During hospitalization patients were evaluated with a cognitive battery; symptoms, occupational history, and other clinical factors were also assessed. At six-month follow-up, patients' symptom remission status was assessed; they were also evaluated as to their occupational status, overall social adjustment, and work adjustment. Multivariate analyses were used to identify predictors of these outcomes. RESULTS: Among the 52 participants, the average rating of overall social adjustment at follow-up was between mild and moderate maladjustment. While 51 had a history of working full time, only 28 (54%) worked full time at follow-up. A total of 24 (46%) had symptoms that met criteria for a full depression or mania syndrome. In multivariate analyses, full-time occupational status at follow-up was predicted by the absence of baseline substance abuse. Better overall social adjustment was predicted by better performance on cognitive tasks of processing speed and by symptom remission; the latter variable also predicted work adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with bipolar disorder have limited occupational recovery and overall social adjustment six months after a hospital admission early in the illness course. Predictors vary among outcomes; performance on tasks of processing speed and the extent of symptom remission are independently associated with functional outcomes.",20100213,12,1,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2009.00784.x,1399-5618

The authors aim to further investigate the existence of volumetric abnormalities in the hippocampus of individuals with bipolar disorder. In addition to methodological inconsistencies, many previous studies have been lacking clinical robustness with respect to characterizing bipolar patients and comparison subjects. Hence, the present study matched the groups closely across a number of demographic parameters. Using MRI, hippocampal volumes of 24 bipolar patients were compared to 24 sex-, age-, and education-matched comparison subjects, and these findings were further investigated in relation to both illness and treatment factors. A significantly larger (8.5%) right hippocampus was seen in bipolar patients than in comparison subjects, and this difference was not associated with a history of psychosis, familial illness, or lithium treatment, after controlling for potential confounds. Patients reporting fewer affective episodes did however have significantly larger left hippocampus volumes than comparison subjects. The authors found that the left hippocampus was larger in a group of adult bipolar subjects relative to the healthy comparison group. The reason for this is unclear, but in this sample, it was not associated with family history, psychotic features, or medication exposure. A negative association was found between left hippocampal volume and number of episodes or duration of illness, suggesting the hippocampus might be larger in the early phase of bipolar disorder but becomes smaller with time.",20100218,22,1,10.1176/appi.neuropsych.22.1.55,1545-7222

It has also highlighted the need for tailoring management to the individual. In particular, the successful treatment of bipolar disorder requires achieving prophylaxis and preventing relapse. In this regard, maintenance therapy is of paramount importance, and thus the tolerability of agents needs to be considered throughout treatment and should be factored into all management decisions. At the centre is the individual with bipolar disorder and the need to maintain a healthy therapeutic relationship.

METHOD: A literature search was undertaken using Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, the Cochrane collaboration database and references of retrieved articles. Controlled and cross-sectional studies with controls published in English up to November 2008 were included. RESULTS: Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have revealed a significant increase in alpha and theta activity during meditation. Neuroimaging studies showed that MM practice activates the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and that long-term meditation practice is associated with an enhancement of cerebral areas related to attention. From a clinical viewpoint, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has shown efficacy for many psychiatric and physical conditions and also for healthy subjects, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is mainly efficacious in reducing relapses of depression in patients with three or more episodes, Zen meditation significantly reduces blood pressure and Vipassana meditation shows efficacy in reducing alcohol and substance abuse in prisoners.

We describe the psychiatric and neurological features, MRI findings, clinical outcome and treatment. RESULTS: Two patients developed persecutory delusions, one presented a manic episode and the fourth melancholia with catatonia. Mean age was 39 years (range 20-49 years). Two patients had a personal history, but none a familial history of psychiatric disease. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an oligoclonal pattern in all patients. All patients fulfilled Barkhof's MRI criteria. Three have had brain MRI with injection during psychotic symptoms. In these three cases, a frontal lesion appeared. The patient with catatonia also had a new lesion in the cerebellum and in the brainstem. All patients needed a psychiatric treatment, including antipsychotics. The psychiatric event lasted three months for two patients and the two others experienced relapse. CONCLUSION: Acute psychiatric symptom may reveal multiple sclerosis at the beginning of the disease.

However, not all bipolar patients benefit from it. A previous study found that a group of non-responders to CT shared common characteristics: they value some of the high goal-attainment beliefs and characteristics associated with being in a state of mild hypomania - a high 'sense of hyper-positive self' (SHPS). To promote of our understanding of this group of patients, the present study investigated the relationship between SHPS, preferred internal state, dysfunctional attitudes and coping with hypothetical manic prodromal scenarios. METHOD: Fifty-four bipolar I patients filled in self-report questionnaires that assess preferred mood state, coping with scenarios, dysfunctional attitudes and SHPS. RESULTS: The Sense of Hyper-positive Self Scale Ideal score (SHPSS-Ideal) predicted patients' preferred internal state of mania. Coping with hypothetical scenarios was predicted by Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) goal-attainment scores: the higher the goal-attainment score, the higher the participant's tendency to identify with self-descriptors linked to hypomania and to engage in stimulating behaviours that may escalate the prodromal stage to mania.

One of the main arguments in support of this suggestion has been the hope that cognitive impairment can help distinguish schizophrenia from bipolar disorder (BD). However, recent evidence shows that cognitive deficits occur in BD and persist beyond euthymia. Further, mood disorders with psychotic features might be expected to manifest greater cognitive impairment, which further complicates the potential to differentiate these disorders. The goal of the current meta-analysis was to examine the magnitude and characteristics of cognitive impairments in affective psychoses (AP). A systematic search of the existing literature sourced 27 studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies compared cognitive performances of 763 patients with AP (550 BD and 213 major depressive disorder) and 1823 healthy controls. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were used to examine the effects of moderator variables. Meta-analyses of these studies showed that patients with AP were impaired in all 15 cognitive tasks with large effect sizes for most measures. There were no significant differences between the magnitude of impairments between the BD and major depressive disorder groups. The largest effect size was found for symbol coding, stroop task, verbal learning, and category fluency, reflecting impairments in elementary and complex aspects of attentional processing, as well as learning and memory. In general, the pattern of cognitive impairments in AP was similar to reported findings in euthymic patients with BD, but relatively more pronounced.",20090922,36,1,10.1093/schbul/sbp093,1745-1701

Here we studied neural correlates of gain and loss expectation in mania using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHOD: Fifteen manic patients and 26 matched healthy control individuals performed a monetary incentive delay task, during which subjects anticipated to win or lose a varying amount of money. Varying both magnitude and valence (win, loss) of anticipatory cues allowed us to isolate the effects of magnitude, valence and expected value (magnitude-by-valence interaction). RESULTS: Response times and total gain amount did not differ significantly between groups. FMRI data indicated that the ventral striatum responded according to cued incentive magnitude in both groups, and this effect did not significantly differ between groups. However, a significant group difference was observed for expected value representation in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; BA 11 and 47). In this region, patients showed increasing BOLD responses during expectation of increasing gain and decreasing responses during expectation of increasing loss, while healthy subjects tended to show the inverse effect. In seven patients retested after remission OFC responses adapted to the response pattern of healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: The observed alterations are consistent with a state-related affective processing bias during the expectation of gains and losses which may contribute to clinical features of mania, such as the enhanced motivation for seeking rewards and the underestimation of risks and potential punishments.",20091202,31,7,10.1002/hbm.20909,1097-0193

RESULTS: Higher levels of trait shame and lower guilt-proneness were found in the bipolar group. Higher levels of shame-proneness were found in the unipolar group in comparison to the bipolar and control groups. BDI scores positively correlated with trait shame and shame-proneness, and accounted for a large proportion of the variance in these scores.

DATA SOURCES: Studies included in the sample were identified through a computer search of articles in English in the MEDLINE database from January 1980 to March 2008. Key terms entered were cognitive and bipolar disorder, cognitive therapy and bipolar disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy and bipolar disorder, psychotherapy and bipolar disorder, and psychosocial and bipolar disorder. STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria were (1) randomized clinical trial investigating the role of adjunctive CBT in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder, (2) clearly defined CBT intervention, (3) the inclusion of a control group, and (4) sufficient data reported to allow calculation of effect sizes. Twelve randomized clinical trials were selected for analysis on the basis of these criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Effect sizes (Cohen d) were calculated according to published procedures. DATA SYNTHESIS: We found a low to medium overall effect size of CBT at posttreatment (d = -0.42, P < .05) and follow-up (d = -0.27, P < .05), and we found a positive impact of CBT on clinical symptoms (posttreatment d = -0.44, P < .05), cognitive-behavioral etiopathogenetic mechanisms (posttreatment d = -0.49, P < .05), treatment adherence (posttreatment d = -0.53, P < .05), and quality of life (posttreatment d = -0.36, P < .05). The impact was less evident in the case of relapse and/or recurrence (posttreatment d = -0.28). These effects on outcome categories were more evident at posttreatment compared to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-behavioral therapy can be used as an adjunctive treatment to medication for patients with bipolar disorder, but new CBT strategies are needed to increase and enrich the impact of CBT at posttreatment and to maintain its benefits during follow-up.",20091027,71,1,10.4088/JCP.08r04559yel,1555-2101

RECENT FINDINGS: Our knowledge about lithium solidly supports its usefulness during all phases of bipolar illness and its specific effectiveness on suicidal prevention. Specific second-generation antipsychotics could constitute a promising option for treating bipolar depression, although only limited data exist so far. Anticonvulsants appear to possess a broad spectrum of effectiveness, including mixed dysphoric and rapid-cycling forms. Lamotrigine may be preferably effective in the treatment of depression but not mania. The usefulness of antidepressants in bipolar depression is controversial. The first line of psychosocial intervention in bipolar depression is psychoeducation, family-focused psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation are options for refractory patients. Accumulated knowledge so far indicates that bipolar patients need continuous administration of an antimanic agent even during the acute depressive phase. SUMMARY: The development of rationalized 'combination treatment' guidelines is essential today, as it seems that the vast majority of patients do poorly on monotherapy and need complex pharmacotherapies. Although our knowledge is indeed limited, the development of some kind of guidelines for polypharmacy is possible and should be done as soon as possible.",20091111,23,1,10.1097/YCO.0b013e328333e132,1473-6578

Despite periods of symptomatic recovery, individuals with bipolar disorder often continue to experience impairments in psychosocial functioning, particularly occupational functioning. Two determinants of psychosocial functioning of euthymic (neither fully depressed nor manic) individuals with bipolar disorder are residual depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment (i.e., difficulties with executive functioning, attention, and memory). The present study explored whether a new cognitive remediation (CR) treatment designed to treat residual depressive symptoms and, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, address cognitive impairment would be associated with improvement in psychosocial functioning in individuals with bipolar disorder. Following a neuropsychological and clinical assessment 18 individuals with DSM-IV bipolar disorder were treated with 14 individual sessions of CR. Results indicated that at the end of treatment, as well as at the 3-months follow-up, patients showed lower residual depressive symptoms, and increased occupational, as well as overall psychosocial functioning. Pretreatment neuropsychological impairment predicted treatment response. Improvements in executive functioning were associated with improvements in occupational functioning. These findings suggest that treating residual depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment may be an avenue to improving occupational and overall functioning in individuals with bipolar disorder.",20091110,16,5,10.1111/j.1755-5949.2009.00110.x,1755-5949

RESULTS: The analysis revealed two overarching themes formed from four themes each.

Multivariate analyses were applied to identify clinical and neurocognitive predictors of functional outcome. RESULTS: The main regression model for predictors of overall psychosocial functioning identified subclinical depressive symptoms (beta=0.516, t=3.51, p=0.002), and free delayed recall in a verbal memory task (beta=-0.314, t=-2.144, p=0.041), accounting for 36% of the variance.

RESULTS: Patients treated with lithium exhibited in comparison to HC a larger right absolute (+17.9%, P = 0.015) and relative (+18%, P = 0.017) amygdala volume. There was no significant difference in amygdala volume between patients without lithium treatment and HC. CONCLUSION: Lithium appears to have a sustained effect on a central core region of emotional processing and should therefore be considered in studies examining BD.",20090704,121,2,10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01428.x,1600-0447

METHOD: Nineteen subjects with bipolar disorder in remission, who reported subjective cognitive deficits, were treated with open-label galantamine-ER 8-24 mg/day for 4 months. Ten healthy volunteers matched for age and gender were also assessed. Mood and subjective cognitive questionnaires were administered monthly. At the beginning and the end of the trial all subjects were administered neuropsychological tests, including tests of attention (Conners CPT) and episodic memory (CVLT). Bipolar subjects underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) measurements before and after treatment, healthy volunteers completed baseline 1H-MRS. We acquired 1H-MRS data at 4.0 T from voxels centered on the left and right hippocampus to measure hippocampal N-acetyl aspartate (NAA, a measure of neuronal viability) and choline containing compounds (Cho, a marker of lipid metabolism and membrane turn-over). RESULTS: Compared to healthy volunteers, bipolar subjects had higher baseline subjective cognitive deficits and lower scores on objective tests of attention (Conner's CPT) and verbal episodic memory (CVLT). After treatment, bipolar subjects experienced significant improvement of subjective cognitive scores and on objective tests of attention (Conner's CPT) and verbal episodic memory (CVLT). In the left hippocampus NAA increased and choline (Cho) decreased in bipolar subjects during treatment. CONCLUSION: Bipolar subjects had cognitive dysfunction; treatment with Galantamine-ER was associated with improved cognition and with increases in neuronal viability and normalization of lipid membrane metabolism in the left hippocampus.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between these factors and auditory ERP measures in BD patients. METHODS: An auditory 'oddball' discrimination task was used to elicit ERPs from 69 patients with type I BD and 52 healthy controls. Patients were placed into subgroups based upon their mood state at testing (euthymic or symptomatic), and ANOVA was used to compare amplitude and peak latency measures from the N100, P200, N200, and P300 ERP components across subgroups. Multiple regression was used to investigate relationships between ERP measures and comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, history of psychotic features, and medication status. RESULTS: Relative to healthy control participants, euthymic and symptomatic BD patients exhibited reduced P300 and P200 amplitude, but ERP measures did not differ among BD patients on the basis of mood status. A history of a comorbid anxiety disorder was associated with reduced N200 peak latency, but prolonged P300 peak latency among BD patients. No other relationships between clinical variables and ERP measures were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that disrupted auditory attention may be observed in BD patients regardless of their mood state at testing, medication status, or history of psychosis. These results extend previous findings, and provide further evidence for aberrations in the P300 ERP as an endophenotype for BD.",20091120,11,8,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2009.00758.x,1399-5618

Our principal objective was to determine the safety and effectiveness of deep brain stimulation of the inferior thalamic peduncle in the treatment of refractory OCD. METHODS: An open protocol was performed from March 2003 to April 2007 in 5 patients with OCD refractory to conventional treatments. Bilateral stereotactic implantation of tetrapolar electrodes was aimed at the inferior thalamic peduncle and corroborated by electrophysiological responses and magnetic resonance imaging. All patients were off stimulation for 1 month after implantation. In the on-stimulation period, parameters were set at 5 V, 450 microseconds, 130 Hz in bipolar and continuous mode. Clinical changes were evaluated every 3 months for 12 months by means of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. Statistical significance was assessed by the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: The mean Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score decreased from 35 to 17.8 (P < 0.001), and the mean Global Assessment of Functioning scale score improved from 20% to 70% (P < 0.0001).

Additionally, relevant studies and critical reviews pertaining to the treatment of adults with ADHD and the relationships between ADHD and mood disorders with regard to overlapping symptom profiles, comorbidity, and treatment options were identified. The symptoms of ADHD persist into adulthood for a high proportion of children with this disorder. Among adults, the estimated prevalence of clinician-assessed ADHD in the general population is 4% to 5%. Untreated ADHD can adversely affect school and work achievements, diminish self-esteem, damage interpersonal relationships, and significantly reduce quality of life for adults.

The mechanism of action of anticonvulsants used in the treatment of bipolar depression is complex and still not completely elucidated. Na(+) channels are present at distinct sites in neurons, where they sub serve different functions and play distinct roles. The fact that most of the anticonvulsants used in the treatment of bipolar disorders are blockers of voltage-gated Na channels has determined our interest in evaluating the role of ion channels in bipolar disorders. OBJECTIVES: The scope of this study was to determinate if sodium channels are important for topiramate and phenytoin to exert their antidepressant-like functioning. METHODS: The role of Na(+) channels in the mechanism of action of the anticonvulsants was investigated by using veratrine a selective activator of Na channels in a mice model of depression, the forced swimming test. Veratrine 0.125 mg/kg and topiramate or phenytoin (16 and 32 mg/kg) were given IP 45 and 30 min, respectively, before the test. RESULTS: The administration of topiramate and phenytoin induce a decrease in the immobility time on the FST which can be considered as an antidepressant-like activity. The antidepressant-like effect of the anticonvulsants was completely reversed by veratrine suggesting that the antidepressant-like effect of topiramate and phenytoin on the FST might be due to their Na(+) channels blocking properties.",20090808,205,2,10.1016/j.bbr.2009.07.030,1872-7549

METHODS: Sixty-one patients with bipolar disorder and substance dependence, taking mood stabilizers, were randomized to 12 sessions of integrated group therapy (n=31) or group drug counseling (n=30). RESULTS: Analyses of primary outcomes showed trends favoring integrated group therapy, with greater reduction in substance use during follow-up and a greater decline in risk of mood episodes during treatment. Secondary analyses favored integrated group therapy, with a significantly greater likelihood of achieving total abstinence, a significantly shorter time to the first abstinent month, and a significantly greater likelihood of achieving a good clinical outcome (a composite measure encompassing both substance use and mood simultaneously).

Among these are the availability of newer stimulant formulations, an appreciation of the combined effects of medication and behavioural therapies, and a better understanding of the neurobiology of the disorder in children (aged 6-12 years), adolescents and adults. This article focuses on the evaluation of the efficacy and safety profiles of medications used for the management of ADHD. In assessing the various medical treatments for ADHD, certain issues and analyses have become important to address. The diagnosis, characterization and quantification of ADHD symptoms are crucial to assessing treatment effectiveness. A standardized setting for measuring the severity of ADHD symptoms is the laboratory school protocol, which simulates a school environment with tightly controlled timing of measurements. This method has been adapted successfully to the adult workplace environment to help with the evaluation of adult ADHD symptoms. Statistical analyses, such as effect size and number needed to treat, may aid in the comparison and interpretation of ADHD study results. Although an objective approach to evaluating the efficacy and safety profiles of the available medications provides necessary details about the medical options, typical clinical decisions are often based on trial and error and may be individualized based on a patient's daily routine, comorbidities and risk factors. Stimulants remain the US FDA-approved medical treatment of choice for patients with ADHD and are associated with an exceptional response rate. Findings of the Multimodal Treatment of Children With ADHD study suggest that the combination of behavioural and medical therapy may benefit most patients. Nonstimulant agents, such as atomoxetine (FDA-approved), and several non-approved agents, bupropion, guanfacine and clonidine, may offer necessary alternatives to the stimulants. This is especially important for patients who have comorbidities that are contraindicated for stimulant use based on medical issues and/or risk for stimulant abuse. Typical psychiatric comorbidities in patients with ADHD include oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety, substance abuse disorder, tic disorder, and Tourette's syndrome. Although relatively safe, both stimulants and atomoxetine have class-related warnings and contraindications and are associated with adverse effects that require consideration when prescribing.

METHOD: Participants were 173 children (aged 6-17 years) with DSM-IV bipolar disorder. Participants were comprehensively assessed using structured diagnostic interviews (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children) and neuropsychological measures (eg, subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III) during the years 2001-2006. Comparisons were made in neuropsychological functioning between medicated and unmedicated youth with bipolar disorder. RESULTS: Children who were treated with mood stabilizers performed significantly (P < .05) more poorly than untreated children on measures of processing speed and working memory. Treatment with other classes of medication, including second-generation antipsychotics, was not significantly associated with neuropsychological impairments.

This study aimed to investigate whether poor treatment adherence is associated with cognitive impairment in euthymic bipolar patients and whether other factors may be associated with both adherence and cognitive functioning. METHOD: Euthymic DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder patients (N = 103: 61 with high levels of treatment adherence and 42 with poor treatment adherence) were assessed using a neuropsychological battery targeting attention, psychomotor speed, verbal memory, and executive functions and compared with 35 healthy controls of similar age, sex distribution, and education. Data were collected from September 2005 to June 2007. RESULTS: Bipolar patients with poor treatment adherence had more hospitalizations than those with high adherence. After controlling for age, gender, estimated IQ score, and Young Mania Rating Scale and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores, non-treatment-adherent patients performed less well than normal controls in verbal learning and some executive functions. Among treatment-adherent and poorly adherent bipolar disorder patients, performance was similar in attention tasks and short-term and long-term verbal recall, but non-treatment-adherent patients were more impaired in ability to inhibit interferences and in spatial working memory. Poorer treatment adherence also was associated with the bipolar I subtype and with greater illness severity, as indicated by number of manic episodes and hospitalizations and history of psychosis. Pharmacologic factors, such as treatment with lithium, may also influence the relationship between neurocognition and adherence. CONCLUSIONS: There is a close relationship between poor treatment adherence and cognitive impairment, but the causal inferences of these findings are uncertain. Poor treatment adherence may worsen the course of bipolar disorder and so indirectly worsen cognitive performance, or cognitive impairment may contribute to poor treatment adherence and reflect more severe illness.",20090606,70,7,10.4088/JCP.08m04408,1555-2101

The purpose of this paper is to briefly review the evidence base for the pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression and to discuss the recommendations for its optimal management. METHODS: A detailed literature review was undertaken with a particular emphasis on pharmacological treatment strategies for bipolar depression across the acute and maintenance phases of the illness. Electronic library and Web-based searches were performed using recognised tools (MEDLINE, PubMED, EMBASE and PsychINFO) to identify the pertinent literature. A summary of the evidence base is outlined and then distilled into broad clinical recommendations to guide the pharmacological management of bipolar depression. RESULTS: Partitioning treatment into acute and maintenance therapy is difficult based on the paucity of current evidence. The evidence from treatment trials favours the use of lithium and lamotrigine as first-line treatment in preference to valproate, and indicates that, for acute episodes, quetiapine and olanzapine have perhaps achieved equivalence at least in terms of efficacy. However, the effectiveness of the atypical antipsychotics in maintenance therapy is constrained by the potential for significant side effects of individual agents and the lack of both long-term research data and clinical experience in treating bipolar disorder as compared to other agents. Conversely, lithium and the anticonvulsants are generally slower to effect symptomatic change, and this limits their usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a tendency for research trials of bipolar depression to differentiate the illness cross-sectionally into the acute and maintenance phases of bipolar depression; however, in clinical terms, bipolar depression invariably follows a longitudinal course in which the phases of illness are inextricably linked, and useful acute treatments are typically continued in maintenance. Therefore, when medicating mood in acute bipolar depression it is imperative to keep maintenance in mind as it is this aspect of treatment that determines long-term success.",20090623,11 Suppl 2,,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2009.00711.x,1399-5618

METHODS: Systematic searches of the MEDLINE and PSYCHLIT databases yielded 19 randomized controlled trials of individual family and group therapies. Outcome variables included time to recovery, relapse or recurrence, symptom severity, medication adherence, and psychosocial functioning. RESULTS: Meta-analyses consistently show that disorder-specific psychotherapies [cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal, family, and group] augment mood stabilizers in reducing rates of relapse (OR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.39-0.82) over 1-2 years. Specific mediating mechanisms include, but are not limited to, increasing medication adherence, teaching self-monitoring and early intervention with emergent episodes, and enhancing interpersonal functioning and family communication. All therapies have strengths and weaknesses. One group psychoeducation trial, demonstrated effect sizes for recurrence that are at least equivalent to individual therapies, but findings await replication. Family interventions have been successfully administered in both single and multi-family formats, but no studies report the comparative cost-effectiveness of these formats. The best-studied psychotherapy modality, CBT, can have beneficial effects on depression, but findings are inconsistent across studies and vary with sample characteristics and comparison treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive psychotherapies can be cost-effective when weighed against observed reductions in recurrence, hospitalization and functional impairments. Future trials need to (i) clarify which populations are most likely to benefit from which strategies; (ii) identify putative mechanisms of action; (iii) systematically evaluate costs, benefits, and generalizability; and (iv) record adverse effects.

The present review sought to identify domains of cognitive dysfunction, methods of assessment, discrimination of iatrogenic from illness-specific etiologies, and pharmacologic strategies to manage cognitive problems in patients with bipolar disorder. METHODS: A selective literature review was performed focusing on studies of descriptive phenomenology and pharmacologic intervention (favoring randomized comparisons when existent but open trials or case reports when not) involving cognition in bipolar disorder populations, healthy volunteers, or other clinical populations. Identification was made of (i) practical strategies for clinical assessment and management of cognitive complaints, (ii) limitations of existing intervention studies, and (iii) recommendations for the design and direction of future research. RESULTS: Cognitive deficits involving attention, executive function, and verbal memory are evident across all phases of bipolar disorder. Most existing treatment studies involve nonbipolar populations, prompting caution when extrapolating outcomes to individuals with bipolar disorder. Differentiating medication- from illness-induced cognitive dysfunction requires comprehensive assessment with an appreciation for the cognitive domains most affected by specific medications. No current pharmacotherapies substantially improve cognition in bipolar disorder, although preliminary findings suggest some potential value for adjunctive stimulants such as modafinil and novel experimental agents. CONCLUSIONS: Circumscribed cognitive deficits may be both iatrogenic and intrinsic to bipolar disorder. Optimal management hinges on a knowledge of illness-specific cognitive domains as well as of the beneficial or adverse cognitive profiles of common psychotropic medications.",20090623,11 Suppl 2,,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2009.00716.x,1399-5618

We investigated whether SCBD and ECI + SCBD are able to improve outcomes and reduce health disparities for young and elderly individuals, African Americans, and rural residents with bipolar disorder. METHOD: Subjects were 463 individuals with bipolar disorder, type I, II, or not otherwise specified, or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, randomly assigned to SCBD or ECI + SCBD and followed longitudinally for a period of one to three years at four clinical sites. RESULTS: Both treatment groups significantly improved over time, with no significant differences based on age, race, or place of residence, except for significantly greater improvement among elderly versus adult subjects. Improvement in quality of life was greater in the ECI + SCBD group. Of the 299 participants who were symptomatic at study entry, 213 achieved recovery within 24 months, during which 86 of the 213 subjects developed a new episode. No significant difference was found for race, place of residence, or age between the participants who experienced a recurrence and those who did not. However, the adolescent patients were less likely than the adult and elderly patients to experience a recurrence. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of SCBD and the additional benefit of ECI independent of age, race, or place of residence. It also demonstrated that new mood episodes are frequent in individuals with bipolar disorder who achieve recovery and are likely to occur in spite of specialized, guideline-based treatments.",20090609,11,4,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2009.00700.x,1399-5618

METHOD: The Hayling Sentence Completion Test was used as a measure of executive functioning and was completed by 39 schizophrenia patients, 40 bipolar disorder patients and 44 healthy control participants. Outcome measures included response initiation and response suppression latency and error rate. RESULTS: The schizophrenia group was significantly impaired on all measures of the Hayling Sentence Completion Test when compared to healthy control participants, and only on some of the measures when compared to the bipolar disorder group. The bipolar disorder group did not differ in performance compared to the healthy control group. Overall schizophrenia patients showed longer response initiation and response suppression latencies, and an increased error rate. Performance of the schizophrenia patients was associated with higher ratings of cognitive disorganisation. Performance was not related to age, gender, predicted IQ or any other clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia patients show a slowing in baseline response initiation and slowed suppression of an inappropriate response. Considering the bipolar disorder patients demonstrated intact performance, altered executive functioning in schizophrenia appears relatively specific to the disorder rather than reflecting other characteristics common to mental illness. Investigations examining which neurocognitive domains are impaired in schizophrenia provide direct implications for treatment options tailored to an individual's cognitive strengths and weaknesses.",20090623,114,1-3,10.1016/j.schres.2009.05.029,1573-2509

Existing interview measures are limited by a paucity of empirical study, a failure to conform to standard suicide nomenclature, or a lengthy administration time. This study presents data on the psychometric properties and factor structure of the brief, layperson-administered Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI) among suicidal youth. METHODS: The MSSI was administered to an inpatient sample of 102 suicidal youth aged 13-17 years. Additional interview and self-report measures were administered to examine the convergent validity of the MSSI. RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings among suicidal adults, the MSSI displayed good internal consistency and expected patterns of convergent validity. Principal component analysis revealed a bidimensional structure, with factors corresponding to (1) Desire and Ideation and (2) Plans and Preparations. Each factor displayed acceptable internal consistency and expected patterns of convergent validity via associations with hopelessness, depressive symptoms, impulsivity, and a self-report measure of suicidal behaviors. The Plans and Preparations factor significantly associated with the presence of a current suicide attempt and with greater suicide intent among attempters, whereas the Desire and Ideation factor did not. CONCLUSIONS: The MSSI appears to be a reliable and valid instrument to assess suicidal ideation among distressed youth. Clinicians are encouraged to pay particular attention to responses on the Plans and Preparations factor given its stronger association with suicide attempt and more serious suicide intent.",20090513,26,8,10.1002/da.20575,1520-6394

It is unknown whether these progressive processes predate the onset of psychosis. OBJECTIVE: To examine gray matter reduction of the superior temporal gyrus over time in individuals at risk for psychosis and in patients with first-episode psychosis. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. SETTING: Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation Clinic and Early Psychosis Preventions and Intervention Centre. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five ultrahigh-risk individuals (of whom 12 later developed psychosis [UHRP] and 23 did not [UHRNP]), 23 patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP), and 22 control subjects recruited from the community. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Volumes of superior temporal subregions (planum polare, Heschl gyrus, planum temporale, and rostral and caudal regions) were measured at baseline and follow-up (mean, 1.8 years) and were compared across groups. RESULTS: In cross-sectional comparisons, only the FEP group had significantly smaller planum temporale and caudal superior temporal gyrus than other groups at baseline, whereas male UHRP subjects also had a smaller planum temporale than controls at follow-up. In longitudinal comparison, UHRP and FEP patients showed significant gray matter reduction (approximately 2%-6% per year) in the planum polare, planum temporale, and caudal region compared with controls and/or UHRNP subjects. The FEP patients also exhibited progressive gray matter loss in the left Heschl gyrus (3.0% per year) and rostral region (3.8% per year), which were correlated with the severity of delusions at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A progressive process in the superior temporal gyrus precedes the first expression of florid psychosis. These findings have important implications for underlying neurobiologic features of emerging psychotic disorders and emphasize the importance of early intervention during or before the first episode of psychosis.",20090408,66,4,10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.12,1538-3636

BDNF polymorphisms have also been associated with the risk of schizophrenia and mood disorders. We therefore investigated whether levels of (pro)BDNF and receptor proteins, TrkB and p75, are altered in hippocampus in schizophrenia and mood disorder and whether polymorphisms in each gene influenced protein expression. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded hippocampal sections from subjects with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD) and non-psychiatric controls were obtained from the Stanley Foundation Neuropathology Consortium. (pro)BDNF, TrkB(T1) and p75 protein densities were quantified by immunoautoradiography and DNA extracted from each subject was used to determine the effect of genotype on protein expression. In MDD, reductions in (pro)BDNF were seen in all layers of the right but not the left hippocampus with no changes in the dentate gyrus. The pattern was similar but less marked for BPD. In addition, BPD but not MDD patients, had bilateral reductions in p75 in hippocampal layers but not in dentate gyrus. No changes in TrkB(T1) density were seen in any diagnosis. These findings suggest MDD and BPD may share impairment in (pro)BDNF expression. However, BPD may involve impairments of both (pro)BDNF and p75 receptor, whereas MDD may involve impaired (pro)BDNF alone. Moreover, the lateralisation of changes may indicate a role of asymmetry in vulnerability to MDD. Hippocampal (pro)BDNF and receptor levels were also affected by genotype, suggesting that allelic variations are important in the hippocampal abnormalities seen in these psychiatric disorders.",20090421,43,14,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2009.03.008,1879-1379

To assess psychosocial function, some psychometric scales were administered (Global Assessment of Functioning Scale and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule), and to evaluate occupational function, the sample was divided according to the current work status (active vs. inactive). Cognitive assessment was performed by means of a neuropsychological test battery tapping into the main cognitive domains (executive function, attention, processing speed, verbal memory and visual memory).

METHOD: Patients with PBD (n = 26) and controls (HC; n = 17; mean age 11.66 +/- 2.70 years) completed cognitive testing at baseline and then again at a 3-year follow-up. Groups were matched at baseline on age, sex, race, parental socioeconomic status, general intelligence, and single-word reading ability. The PBD group received treatment guided by a standardized medication algorithm during the 3-year period. A battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to assess attention, executive function, working memory, verbal memory, visual memory, and visuospatial perception at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: At baseline and follow-up, the patients showed deficits in all of the examined domains. At 3-year follow-up, developmental progress in executive functions and verbal memory was significantly less in the patients with PBD than in the HC. Improvement on attention, working memory, visual memory, and visuospatial perception tasks in the patients with PBD was comparable to that of the HC, but the patients with PBD remained impaired in all domains relative to the HC. CONCLUSIONS: The developmental delay in some neurocognitive functioning in PBD suggests that the illness disrupts cognitive development with potential lifelong implications for reduced functional ability.

METHODS: Performance of 70 bipolar I manic or mixed patients was compared to that of 34 healthy subjects on three tasks specifically designed to study response inhibition, ability to delay gratification, and attention; namely, a stop signal task, a delayed reward task, and a continuous performance task, respectively. Correlations among tasks and with symptom ratings were also performed. RESULTS: Bipolar subjects demonstrated significant deficits on all three tasks as compared to healthy subjects. Performance on the three tasks was largely independent. Task performance was not significantly associated with the severity of affective symptom ratings. However, measures of response inhibition and attention were sensitive to medication effects. Differences in the delayed reward task were independent of medication effects or symptom ratings. During the delayed reward task, although bipolar patients made their choices more slowly than healthy subjects, they were significantly more likely to choose a smaller, but more quickly obtained reward. Moreover, performance on this task was not associated with performance on the other impulsivity measures. Manic patients showed more impulsive responding than mixed patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar I manic patients demonstrate deficits on tests of various aspects of impulsivity as compared to healthy subjects. Some of these differences between groups may be mediated by medication effects. Findings suggested that inability to delay gratification (i.e., delayed reward task) was not simply a result of the speed of decision making or inattention, but rather that it reflected differences between bipolar and healthy subjects in the valuation of reward relative to delay.",20090113,11,1,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2008.00658.x,1399-5618

The processing speed of the VAT was found to be negatively influenced by depressive symptoms. That of the CAT developed favorably with increasing level of education. The performance qualities of the VAT, WRT and CAT were positively related to the participants' educational level. The patients who received antipsychotic treatment performed worse on WRT quality than those who were not treated with antipsychotics. CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive performance was relatively stable during the treatment process and not affected by clinical characteristics or type of medication. Cognitive deficits in patients with depression could be a trait rather than a state marker.",20090108,42,1,10.1159/000187635,1423-033X

Number and duration of psychiatric hospitalizations for a mood or a psychotic episode as well as compulsory admissions and seclusion procedures were recorded for each patient 2 years before ADBCT and during a follow-up period of at least 24 months. RESULTS: The number of hospitalizations, the number of compulsory admission procedures and the number of days spent in psychiatric hospital reduced significantly after ADCBT in comparison to the 2 years who preceded this intervention.

The higher HDRS were associated with increased somatic symptoms.

We investigated these mechanisms in subjects with bipolar disorder and examined relationships to severity of course of illness, use of medication, affective state, age, education, and gender. We measured two complementary aspects of response inhibition: attention-based and reward-based. METHODS: Subjects with bipolar disorder (n=112) and healthy controls (n=71) were recruited from the community. Diagnoses were rendered using the SCID for DSMIV. Impulsivity-related measures included the Immediate Memory Task (IMT), a form of the Continuous Performance Task, and the Single Key Impulsivity Paradigm (SKIP), an operant procedure measuring ability to delay responding for a reward. RESULTS: Subjects with bipolar disorder had fewer correct detections (Effect Size (ES)=0.5), prolonged reaction times (ES=0.88), and decreased discriminability (ES=0.57) on the IMT compared to controls. History of frequent episodes, substance use disorders, or suicide attempts predicted faster reaction times, especially to a commission error. Subjects with bipolar disorder who also met criteria for an Axis II disorder had fewer correct detections, more commission errors relative to correct detections, and poorer discriminability on the IMT than other subjects with bipolar disorder. Subjects with bipolar disorder made more responses on the SKIP than did controls (ES=0.5), with a shorter maximum delay (ES=0.62), consistent with inability to delay reward. Probit analysis showed that faster reaction time to a commission error on the IMT was associated with history of substance use disorder, suicide attempt, or many previous episodes. Effects of medication or affective state did not account for these differences. DISCUSSION: Bipolar disorder was associated with impairment in attention and response inhibition, encompassing impaired inhibition of rapid responses and an inability to delay reward, and resulting in impulsivity.

The SEQ may be conceived as a bridge between psychotherapy process and outcome. Since its introduction in 1980, the original American SEQ has been translated in different languages. However, the reliability and validity of the SEQ have only been assessed for the American SEQ so far. OBJECTIVES: The present study attempted to replicate the dimensional structure of the American SEQ for the Dutch version. DESIGN: SEQ data were collected in a heterogeneous convenience sample of 96 patients, producing 2074 SEQ ratings, with each patient completing at least four SEQ forms over the course of her/his treatment. METHODS: Exploratory factor analyses (principal component analyses with varimax rotation) were used to establish the dimensional structure of the Dutch SEQ. In the American and English studies, factor analyses were only performed on each of the SEQ parts (session evaluation and post-session mood) separately. No factor analyses were run with all 21 items included in the analyses. Different from the English and American studies, the internal structure of the Dutch SEQ was not only established for the separate parts, but was also determined by treating the SEQ as a single 21 item rating scale. RESULTS: Replicating the American and English data analyses, the Depth dimension could convincingly be replicated in the Dutch sample. Moreover, the Smoothness and Positivity dimensions could be recovered in the Dutch sample to a large extent. Different from the American SEQ, the Arousal dimension did not appear as a distinct dimension at all. Factor analyses of all 21 items yielded no more than two interpretable dimensions, encompassing about half of the SEQ items. CONCLUSION: The basic psychological concepts in which the American SEQ is rooted-evaluation and mood- also appear in the Dutch SEQ version. However, the results of the current study do not justify a simple transfer of the four American SEQ dimensions to the Dutch SEQ version.",20081202,82,Pt 1,10.1348/147608308X380750,1476-0835

LITERATURE FINDINGS: A review of the literature shows that between 50 and 80% of patients with schizophrenia do not believe they have a disorder. Studies published on this subject over the two last decades stressed the specificity of this phenomenon in schizophrenic patients, taking into account both its prevalence and its clinical consequences comparatively to other mental disorders. If in bipolar disorders a lack of insight is linked with the intensity and acuteness of symptomatology, there is only a limited relationship between these factors in schizophrenia, thus making lack of insight a trait rather than a state-related symptom. DISCUSSION: Though defined for a very long time as a dichotomic phenomenon, the recent interest on insight in psychosis and the development of assessment tools for its evaluation have made it possible to underline its multifactorial and dynamic characteristics. Although lack of insight related to pathologies may vary across time in bipolar disorders, the results of clinical studies suggest that this phenomenon remains stable in schizophrenia. CONCEPTUAL PROPOSALS: In this review, we will reconsider the evolution of this concept in psychiatry and its definition. The clinical characteristics, which are specifically associated with the lack of insight in schizophrenia will be outlined. We will describe more specifically the model of Amador and Strauss and their assessment tool: the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD). This model developed since the 1990s takes into account the time-related evolution of insight, and can be applied both to bipolar and psychotic disorders. ASSESSMENT TOOLS: The SUMD has six general items and four subscales. The general items estimate the three most widely used definitions of insight: awareness of having a mental disorder, awareness of the achieved effects of medication and awareness of the social consequences of having a mental disorder, and include assessment of both current and past-time periods. Four other subscales, each composed of 17 items, assess awareness and attribution of specific current and retrospective symptoms as well as deficits associated with severe mental disorders. Insight, thus, appears as a multidimensional and continuous phenomenon, since patients' awareness may apply only to part of their symptoms and vary over time. In this article, we will review existing scales assessing insight in schizophrenia. The deficiency of available scales validated in French limits the number of scientific publications concerning this important aspect of the clinical evaluation of schizophrenic patients. THERAPEUTICAL ASPECTS: Finally, interventions to improve insight in patients with schizophrenia are presented. Recent studies have shown cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to be of benefit in the treatment of poor insight in schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that early diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia leads to better prognosis. An important suggestion from theses studies may be that psychosocial therapy needs to focus on explanations that are in tune with the culture, rather than focus on diagnostic labels.",20081217,34,6,10.1016/j.encep.2007.10.008,0013-7006

RESULTS: Raters agreed on presence and absence of problem areas in seven tapes. Kappas for identification of problem areas were 1.00 (grief), 0.77 (role dispute), 0.61 (role transition), 0.57 (interpersonal deficits) and 1.00 (loss of healthy self). Kappa for agreement on a primary clinical focus if patients were to engage in interpersonal psychotherapy treatment was 0.64.

This review synthesizes the cognitive science of imagery and emotion with transdiagnostic clinical research, yielding novel predictions for the basis of emotional volatility in bipolar disorder. Anxiety is extremely common in patients with bipolar disorder and is associated with increased dysfunction and suicidality, yet it is poorly understood and rarely treated. Mental imagery is a neglected aspect of bipolar anxiety although in anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder and social phobia focusing on imagery has been crucial for the development of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). In this review we present a cognitive model of imagery and emotion applied to bipolar disorder. Within this model mental imagery amplifies emotion, drawing on Clark's cyclical panic model [(1986). A cognitive approach to panic. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 24, 461-470]. We (1) emphasise imagery's amplification of anxiety (cycle one); (2) suggest that imagery amplifies the defining (hypo-) mania of bipolar disorder (cycle two), whereby the overly positive misinterpretation of triggers leads to mood elevation (escalated by imagery), increasing associated beliefs, goals, and action likelihood (all strengthened by imagery). Imagery suggests a unifying explanation for key unexplained features of bipolar disorder: ubiquitous anxiety, mood instability and creativity.

These findings are difficult to interpret due to the potential confounding effects of mood-stabilizing medications. The present study aims to compare the cognitive performance of medicated and unmedicated subjects with bipolar depression to healthy control subjects. METHOD: Unmedicated subjects with bipolar depression (UBD, n = 32), subjects with bipolar depression on therapeutic doses of lithium or valproic acid (MBD, n = 33), and healthy control subjects (HC, n = 52) performed neuropsychological tasks measuring affective processing, visual memory, and sustained attention. Performance measures were covaried with age and mood ratings, where applicable. RESULTS: With regard to affective processing, the MBD group exhibited greater response latency than the UBD and HC groups. For the same task, the MBD group made more omission errors during the happy condition than in the sad condition. On a task of sustained attention, the MBD group made more errors than the HC group. There were no significant group differences on measures of visual memory. CONCLUSIONS: Deficits in affective processing were found in the medicated group, while unmedicated subjects appear to be unaffected. In particular, the MBD group made more errors during happy conditions, indicating a potential attentional bias in subjects with bipolar depression on mood-stabilizing medications. The present study also implicates impairment in sustained attention for medicated subjects with bipolar disorder, particularly those with the type II variety.",20081127,10,7,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2008.00628.x,1399-5618

The results presented here expand on those presented in a previous publication by including 2 more years of data and additional analyses concerning diagnosis and economic outcomes. METHOD: A pre-post design was used to measure voluntary and compulsory readmissions, ward atmosphere, patient satisfaction, mean length of stay, and cost-income in the year before CBGT was introduced (2001) compared with the next 4 years. RESULTS: In the years 2001-2005, percentage of total readmissions declined from 38% to 24% (p < 0.02); of those readmissions, 17% were compulsory in 2001 compared with 0 in 2005 (p < 0.02). A progressive improvement in ward atmosphere was observed from baseline to the following 4 years (p < 0.001). There was also statistically significant improvement in patient satisfaction compared with baseline, mainly observed during the first 2 years of the intervention (p < 0.001).

There are no studies comparing these techniques in acute mania. This study compared the short-term efficacy and adverse effects of bifrontal and bitemporal ECT in the treatment of acute mania. METHOD: Thirty-six DSM-IV mania inpatients referred for ECT were recruited for study. They were randomized to receive bifrontal (BFECT; n = 17) or bitemporal (BTECT; n = 19) ECT. None of the subjects were on mood stabilizers during the course of ECT. Severity of mania was measured on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) before beginning ECT and then on Days 3, 7, 11, 14, and 21 of treatment. Cognitive functions were assessed eight hours after the fifth ECT session using the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Paired Associate Learning Test, Complex Figure Test, Verbal Fluency Test (animals and fruits categories), and Trail Making Test, Part A. RESULTS: The subjects in the two groups were comparable on sociodemographic and clinical variables, including severity of mania at baseline. They were also similar in ECT parameters, including seizure threshold and seizure duration. Mean YMRS scores showed faster decline in the BFECT than in the BTECT group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that a greater proportion of subjects in the BFECT group responded (50% reduction in YMRS score) significantly earlier than in the BTECT group. There were no significant differences between the groups in performance on cognitive function tests. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, mania patients treated with BFECT responded faster than those treated with BTECT, with comparable cognitive adverse effects. Since ECT is usually prescribed for rapid control of symptoms, BFECT may be preferred over BTECT in the treatment of acute mania.",20081008,10,6,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2008.00608.x,1399-5618

OBJECTIVE: To use tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to examine WM skeleton (ie, the most compact whole-brain WM) in subjects with BD vs healthy control subjects. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, case-control, whole-brain DTI using TBSS. SETTING: University research institute. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-six individuals, 31 having a DSM-IV diagnosis of BD type I (mean age, 35.9 years [age range, 24-52 years]) and 25 controls (mean age, 29.5 years [age range, 19-52 years]). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fractional anisotropy (FA) longitudinal and radial diffusivities in subjects with BD vs controls (covarying for age) and their relationships with clinical and demographic variables. RESULTS: Subjects with BD vs controls had significantly greater FA (t > 3.0, P <or= .05 corrected) in the left uncinate fasciculus (reduced radial diffusivity distally and increased longitudinal diffusivity centrally), left optic radiation (increased longitudinal diffusivity), and right anterothalamic radiation (no significant diffusivity change). Subjects with BD vs controls had significantly reduced FA (t > 3.0, P <or= .05 corrected) in the right uncinate fasciculus (greater radial diffusivity). Among subjects with BD, significant negative correlations (P < .01) were found between age and FA in bilateral uncinate fasciculi and in the right anterothalamic radiation, as well as between medication load and FA in the left optic radiation. Decreased FA (P < .01) was observed in the left optic radiation and in the right anterothalamic radiation among subjects with BD taking vs those not taking mood stabilizers, as well as in the left optic radiation among depressed vs remitted subjects with BD. Subjects having BD with vs without lifetime alcohol or other drug abuse had significantly decreased FA in the left uncinate fasciculus. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to use TBSS to examine WM in subjects with BD. Subjects with BD vs controls showed greater WM FA in the left OMPFC that diminished with age and with alcohol or other drug abuse, as well as reduced WM FA in the right OMPFC. Mood stabilizers and depressed episode reduced WM FA in left-sided sensory visual processing regions among subjects with BD. Abnormal right vs left asymmetry in FA in OMPFC WM among subjects with BD, likely reflecting increased proportions of left-sided longitudinally aligned and right-sided obliquely aligned myelinated fibers, may represent a biologic mechanism for mood dysregulation in BD.",20080903,65,9,10.1001/archpsyc.65.9.1041,1538-3636

This article reviews randomized trials of adjunctive psychotherapy for bipolar disorder. METHOD: Eighteen trials of individual and group psychoeducation, systematic care, family therapy, interpersonal therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy are described. Relevant outcome variables include time to recovery, recurrence, duration of episodes, symptom severity, and psychosocial functioning. RESULTS: The effects of the treatment modalities varied according to the clinical condition of patients at the time of random assignment and the polarity of symptoms at follow-up. Family therapy, interpersonal therapy, and systematic care appeared to be most effective in preventing recurrences when initiated after an acute episode, whereas cognitive-behavioral therapy and group psychoeducation appeared to be most effective when initiated during a period of recovery. Individual psychoeducational and systematic care programs were more effective for manic than depressive symptoms, whereas family therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy were more effective for depressive than manic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive psychotherapy enhances the symptomatic and functional outcomes of bipolar disorder over 2-year periods. The various modalities differ in content, structure, and associated mediating mechanisms. Treatments that emphasize medication adherence and early recognition of mood symptoms have stronger effects on mania, whereas treatments that emphasize cognitive and interpersonal coping strategies have stronger effects on depression. The placement of psychotherapy within chronic care algorithms and its role as a preventative agent in the early stages of the disorder deserve investigation.",20080917,165,11,10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08040488,1535-7228

RESULTS: In patients with pathological gambling, relative glucose metabolic rates (rGMR) in the orbitofrontal cortex and medial frontal cortex were significantly increased at baseline compared to normal controls. Lithium increased rGMR further in the orbitofrontal cortex, heightening normal/patient differences, but it also increased the rGMR of the posterior cingulate and the dorsolateral frontal cortex normalizing the metabolic rate in these regions.

Event related oscillatory neuroelectrical activity reflects integrative brain functioning, different frequency bands representing different cognitive functions. METHODS: Event Related Potentials to visual odd-ball paradigm in ten manic/hypomanic medication free, DSM-IV bipolar patients were measured before and after six weeks of valproate monotherapy in comparison to ten sex and age matched healthy controls. Different frequency band responses were obtained by digital filtration of ERPs. Young mania rating scale (YMRS) was used to assess clinical response. Repeated measures ANOVA, Wilcoxon and Mann Whitney U tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Patients showed significantly higher baseline occipital beta (18-30 Hz) (p: 0.014) response than healthy controls. They were devoid of the occipito-frontal alpha (8-13 Hz) dominance presented by the control group. Occipital beta response reduced significantly (p: 0.009) and became similar to controls after treatment. Post-treatment alpha responses were significantly lower than baseline in anterior temporal (p: 0.038) and occipital (p: 0.027) locations. Healthy controls displayed a significantly increased frontal alpha response at the second assessment but the patients did not. Mean YMRS score reduced significantly compared to baseline at the end of six weeks (p: 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Alpha response is the universal operator in the brain. Increased occipital beta response in mania may be compensatory to the dysfunctional alpha operation. Its reduction after valproate may be through modulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic mechanisms and indicate medication's corrective effect on the underlying pathogenesis.",20080723,1235,,10.1016/j.brainres.2008.06.101,0006-8993

Although executive/memory function has been posited to be an endophenotype of BPD I, it is unclear whether this extends to bipolar spectrum illness. It is also unclear to what extent non-genetic factors such as childhood abuse, alcoholism and medication influence neurocognitive function. We assessed the neuropsychological performance of a large cohort of bipolar disorder probands and their affectively ill and healthy family members, while controlling for self-reported childhood sexual and emotional abuse, emotional neglect, alcohol abuse and medication. METHODS: A total of 230 largely euthymic participants from 47 families, comprising 49 subjects with BPD I, 19 with bipolar II disorder (BPD II), 44 with recurrent major depression (MDE-R), 33 with a single lifetime episode of depression (MDE-S), 20 with other DSM-IV diagnoses and 65 unaffected relatives, were assessed with a battery of neuropsychological tasks. RESULTS: Sexual abuse, emotional abuse and emotional neglect scores were associated with poorer cognitive performance. After controlling for childhood trauma, the BPD I group performed worse than unaffected relatives on tests of visual recall memory as well as verbal recall and recognition memory. In contrast, individuals with BPD II and bipolar spectrum illness did not differ significantly from unaffected relatives. Treatment with lithium and antipsychotic medication was associated with reduced executive and verbal recognition memory function. After controlling for medication and other covariates, only verbal recall memory was significantly impaired in the BPD I cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Verbal recall deficits may be one manifestation of a genetically driven dysfunction of frontal-striatal cortical networks in BPD I.",20080503,10,4,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2008.00591.x,1399-5618

Prevention programs designed specifically for SMI have relied primarily on principles of cognitive-behavior change theories delivered in a small group format and in venues and services utilized by SMI. Most intervention effects have not been shown to be sustainable over time. We report on our findings relating to the importance of music to Puerto Rican women with SMI and the implications for HIV prevention interventions with this population. METHODS: We interviewed and shadowed over a 2-year period 53 women of Puerto Rican ethnicity between the ages of 18 and 50, residing in northeastern Ohio, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. RESULTS: Nearly one-half of the participants listened to music regularly. Some reported that music was essential to their lives. Participants reported that music improved their mental and social well-being by facilitating expression and reflection of their emotions and increasing their energy levels. DISCUSSION: Music may affect the core negative symptoms and compensate for neuropsychological deficits in women with schizophrenia and related conditions by facilitating the articulation of emotion and allowing individuals to better attend to and potentially incorporate external activities into their lives. The use of music in HIV prevention efforts with SMI Latinas may facilitate their emotional expression and assist them in integrating the educative efforts into their life style choices.",20080409,10,6,10.1007/s10903-008-9142-6,1557-1912

The secondary aim is to present critical comments on methodological issues, highlighting areas for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Traditionally, anxiety disorders have not been viewed as independent risk factors for suicidal behaviour, and therefore assessment of anxiety disorders has not been particularly emphasized in clinical enquiries and suicide screening tools. This review identifies evidence suggesting that specific anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder) may be independently associated with suicidality, to which they particularly contribute when they are co-morbid with bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, or post-traumatic stress disorder, in both child/adolescent and adult populations. SUMMARY: Despite methodological issues preventing firm conclusions from being drawn in most cases, these findings should prompt clinicians to evaluate more specifically the impact of anxiety disorders on suicidal behaviour, particularly when they are co-morbid. Further research into treatment of anxiety disorders in relation to preventing suicide is required.",20080219,21,1,10.1097/YCO.0b013e3282f2309d,0951-7367

Appropriate adjunctive psychosocial interventions in bipolar disorder have been found to be associated with improved treatment adherence, greater stability, fewer hospitalizations, fewer days hospitalized, less need for crisis interventions, decreased relapse risk, and fewer acute episodes. Specific types of therapy that have shown efficacy include bipolar-specific cognitive-behavioral therapy, family-focused therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, and systematic care management. A positive impact on medication adherence is a major goal of these adjunctive treatments. Studies show variable efficacy depending on patient characteristics, phase of illness, and presence of comorbid conditions so that therapies should be selected and administered on an individualized basis that takes into account each specific patient's current presentation and treatment history. For example, psychosocial interventions have been found to be more effective in patients with depressive than manic symptoms and during maintenance treatment.

O transtorno de estresse pós-traumático (TEPT) é um transtorno de ansiedade que se desenvolve após evento traumático, com importante sintomatologia. Quase 100 por cento dos dependentes químicos que procuram tratamento relatam história de traumas, e as prevalências de TEPT têm variado entre 30 por cento e 60 por cento. Entre os alcoolistas, as prevalências de TEPT variam de 10 por cento a 40 por cento. Apesar das altas prevalências, tais transtornos carecem de investigação pelos clínicos. OBJETIVOS: Tem-se como objetivo relatar o caso de um alcoolista com transtorno bipolar e sintomas de TEPT há alguns anos, cujo resultado de tratamento deveu-se ao reconhecimento da última comorbidade e abordagem conjunta das patologias. MÉTODOS: Paciente masculino, 40 anos, participou em uma pesquisa do Instituto de Prevenção e Pesquisa em Álcool e outras Dependências (IPPAD), que investiga a exposição a eventos traumáticos e TEPT em dependentes químicos, respondendo a vários instrumentos. Realizou entrevistas com uma das pesquisadoras visando a este relato de caso. Os resultados foram avaliados por entrevistas com o paciente e aplicação da Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS). RESULTADOS: A DTS foi respondida por ocasião da participação na pesquisa e um ano após, para avaliar resultados de tratamento. No primeiro momento, o paciente pontuou um escore total de 75 pontos e, no segundo, de 40 pontos. A melhora deveu-se ao reconhecimento do TEPT e seu tratamento com psicoterapia psicodinâmica, terapia cognitivo-comportamental e abordagem familiar como estratégias terapêuticas utilizadas. Para o tratamento psicofarmacológico foram utilizados carbonato de lítio, sertralina e clonazepan. CONCLUSÕES: A investigação de traumas e TEPT deve ser rotina no atendimento de alcoolistas.

Contudo, pouco ainda se sabe sobre o efeito que tem estas abordagens nestes pacientes. OBJETIVO: Avaliar a efetividade da terapia de grupo no tratamento do transtorno afetivo bipolar. MÉTODO: Levantamento bibliográfico no Medline, Lilacs, PubMed e ISI de artigos publicados em língua inglesa no período de 1975 a 2005 e busca manual com base na bibliografia dos artigos selecionados. Foram incluídos apenas os estudos que utilizaram grupo controle, randomizados, com casuística superior a 20 pacientes. RESULTADOS: Foram encontrados somente cinco trabalhos, três deles publicados nos últimos cinco anos. Três utilizaram modelos de psicoeducação, encontrando aumento na adesão ao tratamento farmacológico. Um destes verificou redução no número de hospitalizações e recaídas. Dois estudos combinaram psicoeducação e abordagens psicoterápicas variadas. Destes, um mostrou aumento no período de remissão e redução de sintomas para episódios maníacos. CONCLUSÕES: O interesse por intervenções psicoterápicas baseadas em evidência, no tratamento do TAB, vem aumentando nos últimos anos. Este fato contrasta com o baixo número de estudos dedicados à modalidade de atendimento em grupo, que poderia ser muito útil em instituições onde grande número de pacientes é atendido. A complexidade clínica dessa doença, a presença de diversas comorbidades e os diferentes graus de adesão à farmacoterapia demandam a criação de opções terapêuticas variadas que atendam às necessidades de cada indivíduo. Os estudos indicam que a terapia de grupo pode ser uma opção eficaz de tratamento que merece ser mais bem investigado para permitir sua aplicação na prática clínica.",20070719,34,2,,0101-6083

The authors wished to prospectively study the efficacy of lamotrigine as adjunctive or monotherapy in adolescents with bipolar disorder who were experiencing a depressive episode. METHOD: This was an 8-week open-label trial of lamotrigine with 20 adolescents ages 12-17 years (mean age 15.8; 7 boys, 13 girls) with diagnoses of bipolar disorder I, II, or not otherwise specified, who were experiencing a depressive episode. Lamotrigine was begun at 12.5 to 25 mg/day. Primary response criteria was a 1 or a 2 on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement at week 8. A secondary criterion was at least a 50% decrease in Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised scores. RESULTS: Nineteen subjects completed the trial. The mean final dose was 131.6 mg/day. Seven subjects were taking other psychotropic medications. Sixteen subjects (84%) responded by primary criteria, and 12 (63%) responded to our secondary criteria. Eleven subjects (58%) were considered in remission at week 8. Young Mania Rating Scale and Overt Aggression Scale-Modified scores also decreased significantly during the trial. There was no significant weight change, rash, or other adverse effects during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with bipolar depression appeared to respond to lamotrigine treatment, whether as adjunctive therapy or monotherapy, with decreases in depression, mania, and aggression. Larger, placebo-controlled studies of lamotrigine are needed in this population.",20060317,45,3,10.1097/01.chi.0000194566.86160.a3,0890-8567

Following mood increase, the bipolar group changed significantly less in DAS total score than did the other 2 groups, and in goal-striving and achievement attitudes relative to the unipolar group. These findings did not provide clear support for the mood-state dependency theory in bipolar disorder, arguing instead for the presence in bipolar I disorder of dysfunctional cognitions that show characteristic resilience in the face of minor positive mood increase.",20051215,114,4,10.1037/0021-843X.114.4.689,0021-843X

O objetivo deste artigo é examinar as evidências atuais da eficácia de intervenções psicoterápicas no tratamento do transtorno bipolar. Foi realizada uma pesquisa bibliográfica por meio do MedLine, PsychoINFO, Lilacs e Cochrane Data Bank, até o ano de 2004, em que foram procurados artigos originais e revisões sobre as abordagens psicoterápicas utilizadas no tratamento do transtorno bipolar. Há várias abordagens que podem se mostrar úteis no tratamento do transtorno bipolar. A psicoeducação e a terapia cognitivo-comportamental apresentam as evidências mais consistentes e são as técnicas mais amplamente estudadas. As intervenções envolvendo familiares e a terapia interpessoal e de ritmo social se mostram tratamentos eficazes em determinadas situações. Há alguns estudos empregando a terapia psicodinâmica no transtorno bipolar, mas são estudos com limitações metodológicas. Apesar de haver evidências demonstrando a eficácia de determinadas abordagens psicoterápicas no transtorno bipolar, ainda é necessária a realização de estudos posteriores que comprovem tais dados e que desenvolvam tratamentos baseados em modelos etiológicos e que identifiquem tratamentos específicos para as diferentes fases e tipos de transtorno bipolar.",20051104,32,SUPL.1,,0101-6083
