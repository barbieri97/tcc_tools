"Journal Article","Correlates of insider and outsider conceptualizations of recovery.","Objective: The concept of recovery can be based on the self report of the individual experiencing the phenomenon ('insider' perspective) or objectively measured by clinicians and researchers ('outsider perspective'). The purpose of this study was to examine the relations among insider (hope and empowerment) and outsider (symptoms and cognition) variables of recovery. Methods: 66 individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression were administered the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, a battery of cognitive measures, The Hope Scale and The Empowerment Scale. Results: For symptoms, depression and anxiety had the strongest relationships with hope and empowerment. Cognition was associated with a subset of activist oriented empowerment subscales. There were strong relationships among the hope and empowerment measures but few relationships among symptoms and cognition. Conclusions: Relationships exist between insider and outsider conceptualizations of recovery in that symptoms and cognition are associated with some aspects of hope and empowerment.

"Comment/Reply","Seeing the Complexities: A Comment on 'Combined Psychotherapy and Pharmacotherapy for Mood and Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Review and Analysis'.","Comments on the article by M. Otto et al (this issue; see article 2005-01375-010) regarding combined treatments for mood and anxiety disorders in adults. The current author notes that Otto et al suggested that the data do not support the use of combined approaches as the default treatment for these conditions. They advocated a nuanced view of the existing findings and emphasized that much is yet to be discovered about whether and how best to combine psychosocial and pharmacological interventions. An empirical update from several recently completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining combined treatment is provided here, and points of convergence and divergence between these findings and the broader literature are considered. Additionally, this commentary supplements their discussion by (a) supporting their strong emphasis on interdisciplinary research and creativity in conceptualizing and designing combined treatments, (b) emphasizing the importance of studying predictors of treatment response in adequately powered trials to better clarify which subgroups require the additional expenditure of resources associated with combined treatment, and (c) encouraging the development and empirical evaluation of combined treatments for children and adolescents.

"Journal Article","Coping in a world gone sane.","This article present the experiences of the author regarding mental disorders and alcoholism. The author is an artist by trade, an Irishman by faith, and an sober alcoholic by necessity. In 1978, after being sober for 2 years, the troubles with mania lead to a diagnosis of bipolar illness by doctors at a local city hospital. Lithium was prescribed. It worked until 1980 when he resumed drinking. The new professionals administrating his therapeutic care felt that lithium was not going to help him with my bipolar illness. His desperation lead me to take radical steps to get my sanity back. Empowerment would be a good word to describe the process. The author took medication as directed and developed tools to recover from his form of mental illness. The biggest part of his recovery has been working with homeless and incarcerated alcoholics. His life is working despite the odds. And those of us with psychiatric disabilities who aren’t accustomed to success can overcome the obstacles no matter what the roadblocks and challenges.

"Journal Article","Gender differences in psychiatric comorbidity among adolescents with substance use disorders.","The authors examined gender differences in rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders among adolescents with 1 or more psychoactive substance use disorders. Baseline diagnostic data were obtained from 135 adolescents, ages 12 to 19, and their parents-guardians, who participated in a study to develop and efficacy test Integrated Family and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. Rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder were higher among drug-abusing male adolescents compared with drug-abusing female adolescents. However, high rates of disruptive behavior disorders also characterized drug-abusing female adolescents. Similarly, drug-abusing female adolescents exhibited a higher rate of major depression compared with drug-abusing male adolescents. However, rates of dysthymia, double depression (i.e., major depression and dysthymia), and bipolar disorder were equivalent between genders.

"Comment/Reply","What Is the Optimal Treatment of Mood and Anxiety Disorders?","Comments on the article by M. Otto et al (this issue; see article 2005-01375-010) regarding combined treatments for mood and anxiety disorders in adults. The current authors note that in clinical psychiatry, the underlying assumption of using an integrated approach (pharmacotherapy + psychotherapy) is that of an additive model of interaction between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, which could take place on the basis of specific changes to be induced by specific treatments. However, the simultaneous administration of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy is based on a cross-sectional, flat view of the disorders which ignores their longitudinal development. An alternative way of integrating pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy involves their sequential administration. In clinical psychiatry, administration of treatment in sequential order has been mainly limited to instances of treatment resistance and involved different types of drugs, such as in drug-refractory depression. This type of sequential approaches, however, was not targeted to the stages of illness or particularly to residual symptoms. In this paper we describe the development of a sequential strategy based on the use of pharmacotherapy in the acute phase of depression and cognitive therapy in its residual phase. The sequential model introduces a conceptual shift in therapeutic practice. It may also involve the use of pharmacotherapy after psychological treatment, the sequential use of two psychotherapeutic techniques, and two pharmacological strategies. The authors discuss the implications of the sequential model and some related issues which have clinical value.

"Journal Article","Treating insomnia in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders: A focused review.","Despite its known negative effects on physical and mental health, insomnia is an often-ignored condition. Insomnia is both a risk factor for, and a symptom of, several psychiatric disorders and a predictor of death by suicide, making it an important target for intervention. It is the position of the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that the first-line treatment for sleep continuity disturbance should be Cognitive–Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I); however, medical, psychiatric, and psychological communities remain largely unaware of the existence and effectiveness of this therapy. The purposes of this article are to review the following: (a) literature on the relationship between insomnia and psychological health; (b) official guidelines and recommendations for the treatment of insomnia; (c) typical delivery of CBT-I; (d) evidence for the efficacy of CBT-I in insomnia that occurs cormbid with depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and psychotic conditions; and (e) need and opportunities for additional education and training.

"Journal Article","Multidimensional structure of the Hypomanic Personality Scale.","The structure of the Hypomanic Personality Scale was explored in a sample of young adults (N = 884); resulting structures were validated on subsamples with measures of personality traits, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behaviors. Hierarchical cluster analysis and estimates of general factor saturation suggested the presence of a weak general factor, as well as 3 subordinate clusters. The 3-cluster subscales (Social Vitality, Mood Volatility, and Excitement) were moderately correlated but conceptually distinct and were correlated in opposing patterns with a range of personality and psychopathology measures. Results show that cluster subscales suppress total score associations with validity measures. Recommendations are made to analyze Hypomanic Personality Scale data by subscale, and theoretical implications are discussed.

"Journal Article","The nature of and behavioral treatment of sleep problems in youth with bipolar disorder.","Bipolar spectrum disorders (BP) occur in up to 1% of youth and are associated with significant impairment. Individuals with BP are often characterized by a decreased need for sleep or dysregulated sleep-wake schedules. For children, such sleep problems often relate to impairment in school and social functioning. Thus, sleep is an especially important target of intervention for youth with BP because of children's sensitivity to lack of sleep and dysregulated sleep routines. The present paper describes sleep-related issues in individuals with BP while also discussing potential behavioral interventions to improve sleep in youth with BP. Two case examples are presented to illustrate potential interventions.

"Review-Book","Review of Cognitive-behavioral therapy for bipolar disorder.","Reviews the book, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Bipolar Disorder by Monica Ramirez-Basco and John A. Rush (see record 1996-98072-000). The volume is structured as a treatment manual. Cognitive-behavioral approaches to the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, an overview of the diagnosis and prognosis of bipolar disorder, and common psychopharmacological approaches are described in a straight forward and reasonably non-technical manner. This volume should be on the required reading list for any psychiatrist or psychotherapist providing treatment to people with bipolar disorder. In addition, psychosocial rehabilitation providers will gain much insight and learn cognitive behavioral strategies that easily can be applied in a wide range of rehabilitation settings. While the book is not designed as a lay persons 'self help' volume, family members and consumers with high school literacy or above, and knowledge of the topic will be able to understand and benefit from this book.

"Journal Article","Patients' expectancies, the alliance in pharmacotherapy, and treatment outcomes in bipolar disorder.","Bipolar disorder is characterized by a chronic and fluctuating course of illness. Although nonadherence to pharmacotherapy is a frequent problem in the disorder, few studies have systematically explored psychosocial factors related to treatment discontinuation. Previous research with depressed patients receiving psychotherapy has suggested that expectancies for improvement are related to treatment outcomes and that the therapeutic alliance may partially mediate this relationship. The current study found evidence for a similar relationship between patients' initial expectancies for improvement, patient and doctor-rated alliance, and long-term outcomes in bipolar patients treated with pharmacotherapy for up to 28 months following an acute episode. The results highlight the need for the assessment of expectancies and alliance in bipolar treatment and suggest possible targets for psychosocial interventions.

The authors assessed changes in face-to-face interactional behavior over 1 year among families of bipolar patients who received a 9-month family-focused psychoeducational therapy (FFT; n = 22) or crisis management with naturalistic follow-up (CMNF, n = 22), both administered with maintenance pharmacotherapy. Members of families who received FFT showed more positive nonverbal interactional behavior during a 1-year posttreatment problem-solving assessment than families who received CMNF, although no corresponding decreases were seen in negative interactional behaviors. The positive effect of family treatment on patients' symptom trajectories over 1 year was partially mediated by increases in patients' positive nonverbal interactional behaviors during this same interval.

"Journal Article","Observed emotional involvement and overinvolvement in families of patients with bipolar disorder.","Many studies have examined the construct validity of the criticism component of expressed emotion, but little work has been done on clarifying the emotional overinvolvement (EOI) construct. In a sample of 115 recently episodic patients with bipolar disorder, the authors of the present study examined the construct validity of an observational coding system for both appropriate and inappropriate emotional involvement that permitted separate ratings for relatives' intrusiveness, self-sacrificing behaviors, and distress related to the patient's well-being. Findings support the measure's reliability and convergent validity and are moderately supportive of the measure's discriminant validity. Results also suggest that Camberwell Family Interview (C. E. Vaughn & J. P. Leff, 1976) EOI ratings do not discriminate among the different dimensions of the emotional involvement construct (or their appropriateness or inappropriateness) as revealed in laboratory-based interactions. The findings suggest that clinicians working with such families might consider differentiating among the various ways in which family members are involved with the patient and helping them learn to judge under what circumstances such involvement is appropriate and inappropriate.

However, previous studies have judged EE attitudes and causal attributions from the same assessment measure, the Camberwell Family Interview (CFI; C. E. Vaughn and J. P. Leff, 1976). The authors examined causal attributions among relatives of 47 bipolar patients, as spontaneously expressed to patients in family problem-solving interactions during a postillness period. Relatives rated high EE during the patients' acute episode (based on the CFI) were more likely than relatives rated low EE to spontaneously attribute patients' symptoms and negative behaviors to personal and controllable factors during the postillness interactional assessment. Thus, the EE-attribution linkage extends to the relatives of bipolar patients evaluated during a family interaction task.

"Journal Article","Combined Psychotherapy and Pharmacotherapy for Mood and Anxiety Disorders in Adults: Review and Analysis.","Studies suggest a complex relationship between cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy for the combined treatment of mood disorders and anxiety disorders. Combined treatment for depression may have beneficial effects when applied to patients with chronic depression and in cases to prevent relapse. In bipolar disorder there is evidence for a strong effect of psychosocial treatment on the course of the disorder. In the anxiety disorders, there are some benefits in the short term, but combined treatment may limit the maintenance of treatment gains offered by CBT alone. Combined treatment should not be considered the default treatment for mood and anxiety disorders, with the possible exception of bipolar disorder. Instead, decisions whether combined treatment is worth the added cost and effort should be made in relation to the disorder under treatment, the level of severity or chronicity, and the stage of treatment (e.g., acute vs. relapse prevention).

John Russo (see record 1996-98072-000) and Cognitive therapy for delusions, voices, and paranoia by Paul Chadwick, Max Birchwood, and Peter Trower (see record 1996-97983-000). The mental health service system is largely based on the oft encountered, often implicit, belief among professionals that, since Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and other severe forms of mental illnesses have been shown to have a biological basis, there is no point in providing psychotherapy for individuals afflicted with these disorders. These two books represent a welcome exception to this situation. While different in many ways, including their treatment goals and many of their theoretical underpinnings, both books represent an attempt to allow the severely mentally ill to benefit from techniques which have been demonstrated to be effective for less severely disturbed populations. Both approaches illustrate ways that the severely mentally ill may be able to be helped through psychosocial intervention, and both acknowledge the importance of client collaboration in treatment, a consideration easy to overlook when the client has a severe mental illness. The books are also similar in that neither one offers sufficient empirical data to support the effectiveness of its approach. The two books reviewed here represent, in the reviewer's opinion, significant contributions to the field of psychotherapy. Even if the clinician takes issue with the techniques presented or with the theoretical assumptions underlying the approaches, he/she should come away with a renewed appreciation of the importance of including the client in treatment planning, even if the client has a severe mental illness.

The main findings were that if Ms. Dragun had been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and prescribed a mood stabilizer, her suicide could have been prevented; that the “cross-tapering” treatment by her psychiatrist and the clinical management by her health care professionals were inadequate; and that the incorporation of meditation and mindfulness in therapy was inappropriate.

I also discuss (a) whether bipolar II disorder is under- or overdiagnosed; (b) the responses to the coroner’s findings on bipolar II disorder; (c) the impact of the coroner’s findings and recommendations on health care professionals and the public; (d) my personal reflections; and (e) my recommendations for making suicide prevention programs more effective: increased open-minded and respectful collaboration among professionals, the importance of educating legal professionals about the reality of clinical practice, and promoting recognized suicide prophylactic measures. For health care professionals worldwide, especially clinicians, this “Australian Story” provides important insights and lessons.

Using a multidimensional model, the authors evaluated interviewer, patient, and family ratings. Overall, patients with MDD and BPAD evidenced similar levels of family impairment at acute episode and recovery. Generally, patients in both groups experienced improvement in family functioning over time, yet mean scores at recovery continued to range from fair to poor. Although certain specific differences emerged, diagnostic groups appeared to be more similar than different in level and pattern of family functioning.

Challenges prosumers face are highlighted. These include stigma, questions about the impact of illness on ability to work in the field, and the choice of whether to disclose about the illness and to whom. Disclosures about lived experience within public settings, outside of the therapy room, are encouraged for several reasons. Visibility can reinforce recovery, promote understanding and accurate empathy, encourage help-seeking behavior, destigmatize mental illness, and reinforce the development of trustworthy and credible supports.

"Journal Article","Family functioning in bipolar I disorder.","In a sample of 62 patients with Bipolar I disorder, the authors used a repeated measures longitudinal design to examine whether global family functioning was associated with the presence of a concurrent bipolar episode as well as whether global family functioning was associated with the presence of manic and depressive episodes in the following 3 months. Participants were recruited for a randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of family treatments combined with pharmacotherapy for bipolar disorder. Global family functioning was repeatedly measured with both clinician-rated and patient-rated assessment instruments over the 28-month study period. Results indicated that mood episodes were associated with concurrent global family functioning within individuals, but global family functioning was not associated with episode status in the subsequent 3 months. The repeated measures nature of these results suggests that global family functioning and bipolar episodes may fluctuate in concert with each other but that global family functioning is not associated with subsequent change in episode status.

"Journal Article","Psychopharmacology of aggression in children and adolescents with primary neuropsychiatric disorders: A review of current and potentially promising treatment options.","Research examining the role of pharmacological therapy in the treatment of children and adolescents with clinical disorders is growing. Clinical disorders that present with comorbid aggression can add a challenge to treatment. Child and adolescent neuropsychiatric disorders associated with aggression include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, various mood disorders and in particular bipolar disorders/pediatric mania, schizophrenia, mental retardation, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. This review describes the psychopharmacy to treat these disorders and the aggression that often appears comorbidly. Existing literature regarding the efficacy and safety of psychotropics for youth with neuropsychiatric disorders also is discussed. In addition, general guidelines for psychopharmacy of aggression in children and adolescents are presented. Studies reviewed in this article provide evidence for the use of psychostimulants, alpha-2 agonists, beta blockers, lithium, anticonvulsant mood-stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, traditional antipsychotics, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treating pediatric aggression with the choice of medication dependent on symptomology. Despite increased support for pediatric psychotropic use, there is a need for more long-term safety and efficacy studies of existing medications and newer, safer, and more effective agents with fewer side effects for the pharmacological treatment of all childhood disorders in which aggression is prominent.

Otto et al (this issue; see article 2005-01375-010) regarding combined treatments for mood and anxiety disorders in adults. The current author notes that studies that combine pharmacotherapy with psychological treatment for the mood and anxiety disorders must consider the role of moderators (pretreatment variables that specify the conditions under which treatments are effective) and mediators (change mechanisms in the causal pathways between treatments and outcomes) in explaining the impact of experimental treatments. This article gives examples of the kinds of moderators and mediators--both psychosocial and biological--that are important to examine in combination treatment studies. It conceptualizes outcome as involving multiple domains, including mood and anxiety symptoms, life functioning, and illness costs. Research should also examine the appropriate sequencing of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions and how this sequencing may vary from disorder to disorder.

The purpose of the present study was to explore why and how people with a serious mental illness (SMI) choose to stop taking prescribed medication. Method: Seven persons with SMI who had been prescribed and had used medication in the past, but had not taken medication for at least a year, participated in semi-structured interviews, which were recorded and later transcribed. Qualitative analysis provided a foundation for sketching a hypothesized five-stage model of the process involved in choosing to stop medication. Results: This study revealed the subjective experience of taking medication, dilemmas it evokes, and the struggle to develop a personal perspective, plan and choice with regard to medication use.

The study assesses a range of individual variables before and after participation in the program, to examine clinical and personal recovery and facilitate program improvement. To our knowledge, it is the longest ongoing outcomes study (15+ years) of its kind. The program, Gould Farm, provides recovery-focused, milieu treatment on a 700-acre working farm. It integrates counseling and medication with a work program that provides opportunities for the development of daily living, social, and work skills as well as mental and physical health. Clients were interviewed in person at intake and at discharge. Also, since study year 10 when the follow-up arm began, former clients were interviewed at 6, 18, and 36 months postdischarge via phone. Interview protocols included standard measures of psychiatric symptoms and functioning, substance use, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction. Follow-up interview protocols also assessed individuals’ living, working, family, and social situations as well as their satisfaction in these areas of recovery. Statistically significant improvements on all measures were found at discharge, and were not moderated by key demographic or clinical factors. Preliminary follow-up data showed maintenance of treatment gains, and high treatment satisfaction. We discuss clinical implications of the findings as well as limitations, directions for future research, and recommendations for sustaining outcomes research in organized care settings.

"Journal Article","Extreme appraisals of internal states and bipolar symptoms: The Hypomanic Attitudes and Positive Predictions Inventory.","The Hypomanic Attitudes and Positive Predictions Inventory (HAPPI; W. Mansell, 2006) was developed to assess multiple, extreme, self-relevant appraisals of internal states. The present study aimed to validate the HAPPI in a clinical sample. Participants (N = 50) with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (confirmed by a structured clinical interview) completed a series of questionnaires pertaining to clinical factors, reward motivation, cognitive style, symptoms, and functioning at baseline, in addition to the HAPPI. Over the following 4 weeks, participants were asked to complete self-report measures of symptoms (activation, perceived conflict, depression, and well-being), as well as work and social functioning, twice weekly. The authors hypothesized that the HAPPI would be associated with prospective bipolar symptoms and functioning, when controlling for baseline symptoms and potentially confounding measures. The HAPPI was positively, independently associated with activation and conflict after 4 weeks. Furthermore, individual HAPPI factors were associated with activation, conflict, and depression. The results provided preliminary support for the predictive validity of the HAPPI in a clinical sample. The HAPPI could be used in the future as a tool in cognitive behavioral therapy for bipolar disorder to identify problematic beliefs and guide formulation.

"Journal Article","Agenda setting in psychiatric consultations: An exploratory study.","Objective: Patient- or consumer-centeredness has been recognized as a critical component of quality in primary health care, but is only beginning to be recognized and studied in mental health. Among the first opportunities to be consumer-centered is collaboratively producing an agenda of topics to be covered during a clinic visit. Early agenda setting sets the stage for what is to come and can affect the course, direction, and quality of care. The purpose of this work is to study agenda setting practices among 8 prescribers (5 psychiatrists and 3 nurse practitioners) at the beginning of their encounters with 124 consumers diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (56%), bipolar disorder (23%), major depression (15%), and other disorders (6%). Method: We modified an extant agenda-setting rubric by adding behaviors identified by a multidisciplinary team who iteratively reviewed transcripts of the visit openings. Once overall consensus was achieved, two research assistants coded all of the transcripts. Twenty-five transcripts were scored by both raters to establish interrater reliability. Results: We identified 10 essential elements of agenda setting. Almost 10% of visits had no agenda set, and only 1 of 3 encounters had partial or complete elicitation of a single concern. Few additional concerns (4%) were solicited, and no encounter contained more than 6 essential elements. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Collaborative agenda setting represents a unique opportunity to translate the concept of consumer-centeredness into mental health care. Initial results suggest the rating system is reliable, but the essential elements are not being used in practice.

"Journal Article","Memory for therapy in bipolar disorder and comorbid insomnia.","Objective: To examine the extent to which patients recall the contents of therapy from 1 session to the next and to determine whether recall is associated with treatment outcome. Method: Thirty interepisode individuals with bipolar disorder and comorbid insomnia (ages 21–62 years, 56.7% women, 56.7% Caucasian) participated in a randomized controlled trial of psychotherapies. Patients received either cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBTI–BP; n = 17) or psychoeducation (PE; n = 13). At the beginning of each weekly session, patients freely recalled as many therapy points (i.e., distinct ideas, principles, and experiences) as they could from their previous session. After each session, therapists recorded a list of all therapy points delivered. Treatment outcome was measured via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Info System—Sleep, and Quality of Life—Sleep (QOL–Sleep), administered pre- and posttreatment, and treatment evaluation questions administered posttreatment. Results: Patients recalled 19.6% to 36.9% of therapy points listed by therapists. Raw numbers of therapy points recalled were positively correlated with reductions in ISI scores and gains in QOL–Sleep and with most treatment evaluation questions. Percentages of therapy points recalled were positively correlated with gains in QOL–Sleep but with no other sleep outcome measures or any of the treatment evaluation questions. Patients in CBTI–BP recalled more therapy points than did those in PE but did not differ in the percentages of points recalled. Conclusions: Memory for therapy is poor. The amount of content recalled is positively associated with treatment outcome. Enhancing memory for therapy might play a key role in improving treatment outcome.

"Journal Article","Molecular modulation of prefrontal cortex: Rational development of treatments for psychiatric disorders.","Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a central feature of many psychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Thus, understanding molecular influences on PFC function through basic research in animals is essential to rational drug development. In this review, we discuss the molecular signaling events initiated by norepinephrine and dopamine that strengthen working memory function mediated by the dorsolateral PFC under optimal conditions, and weaken working memory function during uncontrollable stress. We also discuss how these intracellular mechanisms can be compromised in psychiatric disorders, and how novel treatments based on these findings may restore a molecular environment conducive to PFC regulation of behavior, thought and emotion. Examples of successful translation from animals to humans include guanfacine for the treatment of ADHD and related PFC disorders, and prazosin for the treatment of PTSD.

Methods: Forty adolescents 14–17 years of age and meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) criteria for borderline personality disorder and substance use disorders were randomized to integrative borderline personality disorder–oriented adolescent family therapy (I-BAFT) or individual drug counseling. This design allowed a comparison of 2 manualized interventions, 1 family based and 1 individually oriented. Profiles of clinical change were used to detect impact and estimate treatment effect sizes. Results: Primary analyses showed that both interventions had a clinically significant impact on borderline personality disorder behaviors 12 months after baseline but with no differential treatment effects. The impact on substance use was more complex. Subgroup analyses revealed that adolescents with depression had significantly more severe profiles of borderline personality disorder and substance use. These youths were the only group to show reductions in substance use, but they only did so if they received the I-BAFT intervention. Study data also documented the high dosage of intensive residential treatment needed by this population. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Results highlight the intensive treatment needs of juvenile justice–involved youths with co-occurring substance use and borderline personality disorder including depression, the hybrid outpatient and residential treatment often required by this population, and the promise of a family-oriented approach, particularly for youths with severe symptoms and co-occurring depression.

Objective: To examine, critically analyze, and summarize the results from studies based on therapeutic models within the CCBT approach (Mindfulness and Acceptance-based interventions, Compassion-Focused Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, and Metacognitive Therapy) for patients with a diagnosis within the psychosis continuum (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder). Methods: Three leading electronic databases (MEDLINE/PUBMED; PsycINFO; Cochrane Library), a grey literature database (OpenGrey), and registered clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.Gov) were searched using combinations of key terms regarding the CCBT models and the diagnosis considered. Reference lists of the relevant studies and reviews were searched. Only Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included. The “Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool” was used for quality assessment. Results: A total of 17 articles were included. This review was based on a majority of unclear or low risk of bias studies. Benefits regarding clinical variables such as psychotic symptoms, anxiety and depression, functioning or quality of life were found. Conclusion: Overall the studies supported some benefits of CCBT approaches for the psychosis continuum. The conceptual perspective on treatment has changed, nevertheless the outcomes assessed are still symptom-focused and there is still need for improvement. Methodological considerations and future directions are presented.

"Journal Article","Pilot effectiveness evaluation of community-based multi-family psychoeducational psychotherapy for childhood mood disorders.","Several psychosocial, family-focused evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for youth with disruptive behavior have proven effective in practice settings. However, limited research has examined community implementation of EBTs for pediatric depression and bipolar disorder. This pilot open trial evaluated multi-family psychoeducational psychotherapy (MF-PEP) with 41 children ages 7 to 12 (54% male, 92% Caucasian) with mood disorders and their parents in an outpatient setting. MF-PEP is an 8-session, adjunctive EBT with parallel child and parent groups. Fourteen community therapists facilitated 6 MF-PEP groups at 3 agencies over 2 years. Developed checklists were used to evaluate adherence. Clinical outcomes were measured via clinician assessment and self-report questionnaires at pretreatment, posttreatment, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up, and analyzed via hierarchical linear modeling. Therapist group adherence ranged from 66.71% to 78.68% (M = 72.14%, SD = 4.85). Children experienced significant improvement in depressive and manic symptoms, and parents reported a significant increase in knowledge of mood disorders. Children with bipolar disorder and families with limited treatment history benefitted most from MF-PEP. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) ranged from small to large for mood outcomes (d = 0.34 to 1.18), knowledge (d = 1.02), and treatment beliefs (d = 0.04 to 0.41). Limitations included small sample, missing data, and open design. Results suggest that MF-PEP may be impactful for families affected by pediatric mood disorders in the community, especially among youth with bipolar disorder and families novice to treatment. Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide more definitive evidence for the effectiveness of MF-PEP in practice settings.

One hundred thirty-four participants, predominately African American and characterized as primarily rural, low resource, and physically frail, were randomly assigned to either CBT or a minimal support control condition. Results indicate that CBT participants evidenced significantly greater improvements in quality of life and reductions in psychological symptoms. Mediation of treatment through cognitive and behavioral variables was not found despite the acceptable delivery of CBT by research therapists. These data suggest that treatment can be effective with a disadvantaged sample of older adults and extend efficacy findings to quality of life domains.

"Journal Article","Efficacy and moderators of a family group cognitive–behavioral preventive intervention for children of parents with depression.","Objective: Building on an earlier study (Compas, Forehand, Thigpen, et al., 2011), tests of main effects and potential moderators of a family group cognitive–behavioral (FGCB) preventive intervention for children of parents with a history of depression are reported. Method: Assessed a sample of 180 families (242 children ages 9–15 years) in a randomized controlled trial assessed at 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after baseline. Results: Significant effects favoring the FGCB intervention over a written information comparison condition were found on measures of children’s symptoms of depression, mixed anxiety/depression, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems, with multiple effects maintained at 18 and 24 months, and on incidence of child episodes of major depressive disorder over the 24 months. Effects were stronger for child self-reports than for parent reports. Minimal evidence was found for child age, child gender, parental education, parental depressive symptoms, or presence of a current parental depressive episode at baseline as moderators of the FGCB intervention. Conclusions: The findings provide support for sustained and robust effects of this preventive intervention.

"Journal Article","Observed parental responsiveness/warmth and children’s coping: Cross-sectional and prospective relations in a family depression preventive intervention.","The current study examined concurrent and prospective relations between observed parenting behaviors and children’s coping strategies in the context of a preventive intervention designed to change both parenting and children’s use of secondary control coping. Questionnaires and direct observations were obtained from parents with a history of depression (N = 180) and their children (ages 9–15 years) at baseline, 6-month (after completion of the intervention), and 18-month follow-up assessments. Cross-sectional analyses indicate that baseline observed parental responsiveness/warmth was significantly associated with composite parent/child reports of children’s baseline primary control, secondary control, and disengagement coping. Using a mixed effects model, prospective mediational analyses indicate that intervention-driven improvements in observed parental responsiveness/warmth from baseline to 6 months significantly accounted for increases in children’s use of secondary control coping strategies from baseline to the 18-month follow-up assessment. No significant mediation effects emerged for primary control coping or disengagement coping. The present findings suggest that it may be possible to improve children’s coping strategies not only through targeted interventions, but also indirectly by improving responsive and warm parenting behaviors. Limitations and strengths are noted and implications for future research are outlined.

"Journal Article","A pragmatic randomized clinical trial of behavioral activation for depressed pregnant women.","Objective: Depression among pregnant women is a prevalent public health problem associated with poor maternal and offspring development. Behavioral activation (BA) is a scalable intervention aligned with pregnant women’s preference for nonpharmacological depression care. This is the first test of the effectiveness of BA for depression among pregnant women, which aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BA as compared with treatment as usual (TAU). Method: Pregnant women (mean age = 28.75 years; SD = 5.67) with depression symptoms were randomly assigned to BA (n = 86) or TAU (n = 77). Exclusion criteria included known bipolar or psychotic disorder or immediate self-harm risk. Follow-up assessment occurred 5 and 10 weeks postrandomization and 3 months postpartum using self-report measures of primary and secondary outcomes and putative targets. Results: Compared with TAU, BA was associated with significantly lower depressive symptoms (d = 0.34, p = .04) and higher remission (56.3% vs. 30.3%, p = .003). BA also demonstrated significant advantage on anxiety and perceived stress. Participants attended most BA sessions and reported high satisfaction. Participants in BA reported significantly higher levels of activation (d = 0.69, p < .0002) and environmental reward (d = 0.54, p < .003) than those who received TAU, and early change in both of these putative targets significantly mediated subsequent depression outcomes. Conclusions: BA is effective for pregnant women, offering significant depression, anxiety, and stress benefits, with mediation analyses supporting the importance of putative targets of activation and environmental reward.

Method: Parents with a history of MDD and their 9- to 15-year-old children were randomly assigned to a FGCB intervention or a written information comparison condition. Children's internalizing, externalizing, anxiety/depression, and depressive symptoms; episodes of MDD and other psychiatric diagnoses; and parents' depressive symptoms and episodes of MDD were assessed at 18 and 24 months after randomization. Results: Children in the FGCB condition were significantly lower in self-reports of anxiety/depression and internalizing symptoms at 18 months and were significantly lower in self-reports of externalizing symptoms at 18 and 24 months. Rates of MDD were significantly lower for children in the FGCB intervention over the 24-month follow-up (odds ratio = 2.91). Marginal effects were found for parents' symptoms of depression at 18 and 24 months but not for episodes of MDD. Conclusions: Support was found for a FGCB preventive intervention for children of parents with a history of MDD significantly reducing children's episodes of MDD over a period of 2 years.

"Journal Article","Treating insomnia improves mood state, sleep, and functioning in bipolar disorder: A pilot randomized controlled trial.","Objective: To determine if a treatment for interepisode bipolar disorder I patients with insomnia improves mood state, sleep, and functioning. Method: Alongside psychiatric care, interepisode bipolar disorder I participants with insomnia were randomly allocated to a bipolar disorder–specific modification of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBTI-BP; n = 30) or psychoeducation (PE; n = 28) as a comparison condition. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, the end of 8 sessions of treatment, and 6 months later. This pilot was conducted to determine initial feasibility and generate effect size estimates. Results: During the 6-month follow-up, the CBTI-BP group had fewer days in a bipolar episode relative to the PE group (3.3 days vs. 25.5 days). The CBTI-BP group also experienced a significantly lower hypomania/mania relapse rate (4.6% vs. 31.6%) and a marginally lower overall mood episode relapse rate (13.6% vs. 42.1%) compared with the PE group. Relative to PE, CBTI-BP reduced insomnia severity and led to higher rates of insomnia remission at posttreatment and marginally higher rates at 6 months. Both CBTI-BP and PE showed statistically significant improvement on selected sleep and functional impairment measures. The effects of treatment were well sustained through follow-up for most outcomes, although some decline on secondary sleep benefits was observed. Conclusions: CBTI-BP was associated with reduced risk of mood episode relapse and improved sleep and functioning on certain outcomes in bipolar disorder. Hence, sleep disturbance appears to be an important pathway contributing to bipolar disorder. The need to develop bipolar disorder–specific sleep diary scoring standards is highlighted.

HOPES includes 1 year of intensive skills training and health management, followed by a 1-year maintenance phase. Method: To evaluate effects of HOPES on social skills and psychosocial functioning, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with 183 older adults with SMI (58% schizophrenia spectrum) age 50 and older at 3 sites who were assigned to HOPES or treatment as usual with blinded follow-up assessments at baseline and 1- and 2-year follow-up. Results: Retention in the HOPES program was high (80%). Intent-to-treat analyses showed significant improvements for older adults assigned to HOPES compared to treatment as usual in performance measures of social skill, psychosocial and community functioning, negative symptoms, and self-efficacy, with effect sizes in the moderate (.37–.63) range. Exploratory analyses indicated that men improved more than women in the HOPES program, whereas benefit from the program was not related to psychiatric diagnosis, age, or baseline levels of cognitive functioning, psychosocial functioning, or social skill. Conclusions: The results support the feasibility of engaging older adults with SMI in the HOPES program, an intensive psychiatric rehabilitation intervention that incorporates skills training and medical case management, and improves psychosocial functioning in this population. Further research is needed to better understand gender differences in benefit from the HOPES program.

"Journal Article","Pilot study: Brief posttrauma nightmare treatment for persons with bipolar disorder.","Previous research on an efficacious cognitive-behavioral treatment for posttrauma nightmares and sleep disturbances (exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy; ERRT) has not tested the treatment in individuals with bipolar disorder. However, research suggests that individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder are at increased risk for trauma exposure and development of posttrauma symptoms. The present pilot study sought to examine the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a modified version of ERRT (ERRT-B) on reducing the frequency and severity of nightmares and improving sleep quality for 7 trauma-exposed individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder who also reported frequent posttrauma nightmares (experienced on average for 16 years). Participants attended 5 weeks of ERRT-B and completed baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up assessments to measure changes in nightmare frequency, nightmare severity, and associated symptoms. Large effect sizes were observed for nightmare frequency, nightmare severity, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, with 6 participants reporting zero nightmares at the 3-month follow-up assessment. Improvements in depression, global sleep quality, and insomnia severity were mixed. Results obtained from this study offer preliminary evidence in support of ERRT-B in reducing nightmare frequency and severity, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. These results suggest clinical utility for the treatment of trauma-related nightmares in individuals with bipolar disorder and encourage more research.

"Journal Article","Family communication with teens at clinical high-risk for psychosis or bipolar disorder.","Previous research has found that family problem-solving interactions are more constructive and less contentious when there is a family member with bipolar disorder compared with schizophrenia. The present study extended this research by examining whether family problem-solving interactions differ between clinical high-risk (CHR) stages of each illness. Trained coders applied a behavioral coding system (O’Brien et al., 2014) to problem-solving interactions of parents and their adolescent child, conducted just prior to beginning a randomized trial of family-focused therapy. The CHR for psychosis sample included 58 families with an adolescent with attenuated positive symptoms, brief intermittent psychosis, or genetic risk and functional deterioration; the CHR for bipolar disorder sample included 44 families with an adolescent with “unspecified” bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder and at least one first or second degree relative with bipolar I or II disorder. When controlling for adolescent gender, age, functioning, and parent education, mothers of youth at CHR for psychosis displayed significantly more conflictual and less constructive communication than did mothers of youth at CHR for bipolar disorder. Youth risk classification did not have a significant relationship with youths’ or fathers’ communication behavior. The family environment among help-seeking adolescents may be more challenging for families with an adolescent at CHR for psychosis compared with bipolar illness. Accordingly, families of adolescents at clinical high-risk for psychosis may benefit from more intensive or focused communication training than is required by families of adolescents at clinical high-risk for bipolar disorder or other mood disorders.

"Journal Article","A randomized trial of group therapy for resource activation for patients with affective disorder.","Resource activation is a common factor of psychotherapy and has an effect on the treatment success regardless of the specific orientation. A balanced focus on resources and problems seems to constitute a promising therapy method. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a novel group therapy for resource activation (GTRA) for inpatients with unipolar depressive and bipolar affective disorders experiencing a depressive episode. Primary outcome criteria were the change in resources and in depression severity. Eighty-nine patients with unipolar depressive and bipolar affective disorders (57.3% female, mean age = 39.9 years) took part in a randomized, controlled trial comparing GTRA plus treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU alone. A comparison of the intervention (GTRA plus TAU) and control group (TAU) showed significantly higher improvements over time in “current relationships” and “fostering self-esteem” in the intervention group but no significant group differences in depression severity. Over the course of the GTRA, participants reported positive experiences of coping and clarification and showed significant increases in problem activation and improvements in subjective session outcomes. This study can be understood as a preliminary effort to pave the way for further refinement and testing of GTRA for patients with affective disorders in addition to TAU in an inpatient care setting. Future research should focus on improving the efficacy of the GTRA by varying different therapy components (e.g., the duration of the GTRA).

Treatments for anxiety disorders that are well integrated into substance use disorder treatment have the potential to improve both anxiety and substance use outcomes. Method: Ninety-seven individuals seeking treatment at a community-based, evidence-based intensive outpatient program for substance use disorders who also had anxiety disorders were randomized to either (a) usual care (UC) at the intensive outpatient program; or (b) UC + coordinated anxiety learning and management for addiction recovery centers (CALM ARC), a 7-session, group-based, computer-assisted but therapist-directed treatment for anxiety disorders adapted for individuals with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder comorbidity. Results: CALM ARC + UC outperformed UC on measures of anxiety and substance use at posttreatment and at a 6-month follow-up.

"Journal Article","Alcohol craving in patients diagnosed with a severe mental illness and alcohol use disorder: Bidirectional relationships between approach and avoidance inclinations and drinking.","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 81(6) of Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology (see record 2013-32932-001). Stephen A. Maisto should have been listed as being affiliated with Syracuse University in the byline and author note. All versions of this article have been corrected.] Objective: The current study was undertaken to better understand the craving–drinking relationship among individuals dually diagnosed with a severe mental illness (SMI) and an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Using an ambivalence conceptualization of craving (Breiner, Stritzke, & Lang, 1999), we investigated the bidirectional relationships between desires and behavioral intentions to use (approach inclinations) and not use (avoidance inclinations) alcohol and drinking outcomes in patients diagnosed with an SMI-AUD. Method: Patients (N = 278) seeking outpatient dual diagnosis treatment from a community mental health center were followed longitudinally over the course of 6 months. Assessments at baseline, 2-month, 4-month, and 6-month intervals included approach and avoidance inclinations, alcohol urges, readiness to change, and drinking outcomes. Results: Time-lagged multilevel growth curve modeling found that avoidance inclinations moderated the effect of approach inclinations on subsequent drinking outcomes differentially over time. Specifically, avoidance inclinations attenuated the effect of approach on subsequent heavier drinking levels, and high avoidance/low approach demonstrated significant decreases on levels of drinking over time. Results also indicated that number of drinks consumed and heavy drinking days predicted subsequent approach inclinations differentially over time, such that lower levels of drinking predicted decreases in approach inclinations. Decreases in drinking also predicted higher subsequent avoidance inclinations, which were maintained over time. Conclusions: These findings highlight the complexity of subjective craving responses and the importance of measuring both approach and avoidance inclinations. Among those diagnosed with SMI-AUDs, treatment strategies that increase avoidance inclinations may increase abstinence rates in this difficult-to-treat population.

"Journal Article","Psychiatric disorders and sexual risk among adolescents in mental health treatment.","Objective: To examine the relationship between psychiatric disorders and sexual behaviors among adolescents receiving mental health treatment. Adolescents in mental health treatment have been found to have higher rates of HIV risk behavior than their peers, but data concerning the relationship between psychopathology and risk are inconsistent and limited. Method: Eight hundred and forty adolescents (56% female, 58% African American, mean age = 14.9 years) and their parents completed computerized assessments of psychiatric symptoms via the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (Shaffer, 2000a, 2000b). Adolescents also reported on sexual risk behaviors (vaginal/anal sex, condom use at last sex) and completed urine screens for a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Results: Adolescents meeting criteria for mania, externalizing disorders (oppositional defiant, conduct, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders), or comorbid for externalizing and internalizing disorders (major depressive, generalized anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorders) were significantly more likely to report a lifetime history of vaginal or anal sex than those who did not meet criteria for any psychiatric disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0, 2.3, and 1.9, respectively). Adolescents meeting criteria for mania were significantly more likely to have 2 or more partners in the past 90 days (OR = 3.2) and to test positive for a STI (OR = 4.3) relative to adolescents who did not meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Conclusions: The presence of internalizing and externalizing disorders, especially mania, suggests the need for careful screening and targeting of adolescent sexual behavior during psychiatric treatment.

"Journal Article","Randomized controlled trial of a family cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention for children of depressed parents.","A family cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention for parents with a history of depression and their 9–15-year-old children was compared with a self-study written information condition in a randomized clinical trial (n = 111 families). Outcomes were assessed at postintervention (2 months), after completion of 4 monthly booster sessions (6 months), and at 12-month follow-up. Children were assessed by child reports on depressive symptoms, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems; by parent reports on internalizing and externalizing problems; and by child and parent reports on a standardized diagnostic interview. Parent depressive symptoms and parent episodes of major depression also were assessed. Evidence emerged for significant differences favoring the family group intervention on both child and parent outcomes; strongest effects for child outcomes were found at the 12-month assessment with medium effect sizes on most measures. Implications for the prevention of adverse outcomes in children of depressed parents are highlighted.

"Journal Article","Effects of family intervention on psychosocial functioning and mood symptoms of youth at high risk for bipolar disorder.","Objectives: Family-focused therapy (FFT) is associated with reduced rates of mood episodes among youth at high risk for bipolar disorder (BD). In a randomized trial of FFT compared to a psychoeducation-only treatment (enhanced care, EC), we sought to determine if changes in psychosocial functioning mediate mood improvements among high-risk youth. Method: 119 youths with active mood symptoms and a family history of BD were randomized to either 4 months of FFT or EC. Participants were rated on mood symptom severity and provided self-ratings of psychosocial functioning across domains of family, social–emotional, and school functioning. Repeated measures mixed modeling and bootstrapped mediational analyses evaluated the effects of treatment conditions and psychosocial functioning on mood improvements immediately posttreatment and over 2 years of follow-up. Results: Youths in FFT reported greater improvements in family functioning over 24 months compared to those in EC, F(5, 76.8) = 3.1, p B = −0.22, p < .01; 95% CI [−0.55, −0.02]. The effects of FFT versus EC on family functioning were stronger among youth with comorbid anxiety and externalizing disorders than among youth without these comorbid disorders. Conclusions: The findings suggest a temporal link between changes in youths’ perceptions of family functioning and improvements in depressive symptoms among high-risk youth in FFT. Family conflict and cohesion are important treatment targets for youth who present with early signs of BD. Future studies should examine whether changes in observational measures of family interaction precede improvements in mood among high-risk youth.
